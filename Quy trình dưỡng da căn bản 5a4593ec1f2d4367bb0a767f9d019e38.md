# The Ultimate Beginner's Guide to Skin Care

If you're unsure about how to put together a skin-care routine (no judgment here), or you're looking to brush up on the basics, consider this your expert-backed guide.
Though everyone has different skin — and therefore different skin issues, concerns, goals, etc. — there are certain skin-routine rules that generally apply across the board. These are otherwise known as the basics, and we consulted a slew of dermatologists to confirm exactly what they are and share skin-care tips that apply to all of us, novices and experts alike. If you're unsure about how to put together a skin-care routine (no judgment here), or you're looking to brush up on the basics, here is your expert-backed beginner's guide to skin care.

If there is one certainty among the many, many uncertainties in our world right now, it is this: Taking the time to care for ourselves should no longer be considered an indulgence, or even a luxury. Rather, for so many reasons, it's a necessity — now more than ever. With **skin care**, though, there is another undeniable truth: It can often feel overwhelming.

![Untitled](Quy%20tri%CC%80nh%20du%CC%9Bo%CC%9B%CC%83ng%20da%20ca%CC%86n%20ba%CC%89n%205a4593ec1f2d4367bb0a767f9d019e38/Untitled%202.png)

Those basics should always include the following three steps, performed in the following order:

## **Step 1: Cleanse**

The general rule of thumb here is that cleansing your complexion twice per day — once in the morning, once in the evening — is ideal. Cleansing in the morning will help to remove any evidence of sweat or oil left from your pillow and hair during your beauty sleep.
There is one common exception to the twice-daily rule: Dry skin. If you tend to be dry, it’s OK to use plain water in the morning.

Cleansing your skin in the evening, however, should never be compromised or skipped. At the end of the day, it’s important to cleanse to remove not only skin-care products and makeup that you applied in the morning, but also excess oil, sweat, dead skin cells, pollutants, and other debris that collect on the skin throughout the day.

## **Step 2: Moisturize**

![Untitled](Quy%20tri%CC%80nh%20du%CC%9Bo%CC%9B%CC%83ng%20da%20ca%CC%86n%20ba%CC%89n%205a4593ec1f2d4367bb0a767f9d019e38/Untitled%204.png)

Next, use a moisturizer, or a moisturizing product. You should use an oil-free, fragrance-free moisturizer as this will be well tolerated in [all] skin types, from acne-prone to sensitive."
The general list of skin-care ingredients is a very long and ever-changing one, so for the purpose of this article, here are some of the top ones to know as they pertain to moisturizer:

- Hyaluronic acid: Plumps skin and restores lost hydration.
- Ceramides: Crucial for skin-barrier strength and overall health (and important for those with dry skin and eczema).
- Vitamin C: Provides antioxidant protection and overall skin brightening.

If you have oily or acne-prone skin, don't think you can (or should) bypass daily moisturizer use. Over-washing without the appropriate use of a moisturizer will actually trigger an over-production of oil on your skin.

## **Step 3: Protect**

Sunscreen is your first line of defense and protection against skin cancer. If you were to do nothing else for your skin, sun protection is the most important.
Opt for a sunscreen that is SPF 30 or higher, and apply it daily (even when it's cloudy), always as the final step in your skin-care routine.

# **Remember these important tips**

## **Less is more**

As your skin-care routine continues to develop and evolve, perhaps the most important piece of information to remember as you're slathering on products is this: Less is often more.

## **Have patience**

If a new skin-care routine doesn't seem like it's "working" right away, know that when it comes to skin care, patience is a must (and if any product promises immediate results, be weary)

## **Consistency is key**

Stay consistent.  As with many things in life, consistency — going through the same skin-care routine steps every day, morning and night — is key to producing and maintaining real results. Bottom line: Trust in the process (and your own skin), and follow through with whatever plan you set out for yourself.
