I am a student. My sister work as a doctor. When I go to school, she go to the hospital to work. 

Lỗi sai chính là ở câu số 2. "My sister" chính là ngôi thứ 2 số ít (He/She/It). Khi sử dụng thì Present Simple (Hiện tại đơn), bạn phải thêm "s" hoặc "es" phía sau động từ chính ngay sau ngôi thứ 2 số ít. Câu đúng sẽ là: **My sister works** as a doctor.

# Lỗi 2: Danh từ đếm được số nhiều thiếu "s/es"

Một lỗi khác rất phổ biến là khi viết danh từ số nhiều là các bạn rất hay quên thêm "s" hoặc "es" phía sau! Hãy nhìn qua những câu sau đây xem bạn có "bắt lỗi được không nhé!

I want to buy 2 banana and 5 kilograms of strawberry.
Many student need to learn English in order to catch up with the high demand of their future work.

- **Đáp án**
    
    Bạn đã nhìn thấy chưa? Chính là các danh từ đếm được ở dạng số nhiều đó! Các câu trên phải được sửa lại như sau:

# Lỗi 3: Phân biệt danh từ không đếm được

Với lỗi số 2, các bạn đã nhớ phải thêm "s" hoặc "es" ở phía sau danh từ đếm được số nhiều.
Vậy thì với lỗi số 3 này, các bạn hãy chú ý không tùy tiện thêm "s" hay "es" lung tung sau những danh từ không đếm được nha! 
Cùng nhìn xuống danh sách từ vựng bên dưới, và hãy chỉ ra đâu là các **danh từ không đếm được (Uncountable Noun)**:

advice 
apple
furniture
shoe
tea
sugar
house
knowledge

- **Đáp án**
    
    advice/furniture/tea/sugar/knowledge
    

Cùng dò lỗi các câu bên dưới!

He always tries to get a lot of advices from his mentor.
I want to buy a bunch of furnitures for my new house.

    I want to buy a bunch of **furniture** for my new house.

# Lỗi 4: V-ing và to V

Có bao giờ bạn từng viết những câu kiểu này chưa?

![https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523906630133-f6934a1ab2b9?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=srgb](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1523906630133-f6934a1ab2b9?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=85&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=srgb)

I enjoy to watch Netflix at the weekend.
She wants cook at home.
Are you ready for to dance?
They want singing karaoke tonight.

Những câu này đều phạm phải lỗi sai khi sử dụng V-ing và to V không phù hợp nghĩa và ngữ cảnh!

- **Đáp án**
    
    I **enjoy watching** Netflix at the weekend.
    She **wants to cook** at home.
    Are you **ready to dance**?
    They **want to sing** karaoke tonight.
    

Bạn có nhận ra quy luật gì sau khi xem đáp án không? Một số động từ đặc biệt sẽ phải có nguyên tắc thêm -ing sau động từ chính hoặc thêm to V nguyên mẫu! Ví dụ:
**enjoy/love/like + V-ing
want/need + to V**

Nhớ chép lại liền để không quên nha! 😄

<aside>
