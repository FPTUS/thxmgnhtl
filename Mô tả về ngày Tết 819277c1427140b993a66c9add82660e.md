    why are there different accents in the regions of vietnam why do vietnamese have two wedding ceremonies why do vietnamese have french words why is vietnamese in latin why do vietnamese right motorbikes you're listening to why do vietnamese a cultural podcast by visar [Music] welcome to why the vietnamese vietnamese culture talks with vsar each episode we pick a new topic of why do vietnamese do this or that and share our personal insights on the take we hope that through these podcasts we can help answer your questions that you didn't even know you had about vietnamese culture my name is ryan president of vsar for 2021 2022 and your host for today joining me is my fellow visa member jang jiang would you like to introduce yourself oh thank you brian so hello guys my name is juan you might also know me through my english name as alison and i am currently a member of the culture team i am very excited for this podcast so thank you first of all for listening thank you for joining me today i know that you're in vietnam right now so there is a 12 hour difference between us but you you're still here and here to share your experiences and we're excited to hear what you have to share with us so as always with all of our episodes we're going to start with a v music feature before we get started into our actual topic and this will be a song related to our um our topic for today if you haven't haven't already guessed based on my background and the title of the video or the podcast uh we're gonna get right into the music feature okay all right so from that song tiang what do you think today's topic is going to be about um well i think i know it not only from the song but also like from the vibe of your uh background today we're gonna be talking about the moon festival so our today's topic is about the tumto or the manure festival or the moon festival so it's gonna be the question of why do vietnamese celebrate the mid-autumn festival so do you already have an idea as to why we celebrate this festival um well to my perspective i think it's more of like a history thing because uh you know our culture is somewhat similar to all the like all the other asian cultures such as korea china or um well i would say mongolian as well they also celebrate this festival according to my knowledge so first of all it's the culture and then it is also the you know history we have been celebrating it for a long time we also have a lot of folk tales and um well i would say myth related to the topic so it is a very important part of our culture and you know keep celebrating them keep eating the mooncake yeah so actually the origin uh as to what most people believe of like not not any myths yet but just the origin of what we believe for where this origin of this festival came from was historically many of the vietnamese people and east asian peoples or just people around the world were farmers and during this time of mid-autumn around the end of august on the lunar calendar and marks the end of a harvest season so in order to celebrate the harvest season they had this festival to pay homage to the moon as well as gather together as a gathering and a reason to gather together and reunite with a greater family after a year of long work and to celebrate a good harvest it's almost like thanksgiving in the western world where we have it in october um in canada and it's like a get-together and you have foods that are comfort food that are warm bringing together and it's all about that fall cooler season so that's the actual historical origin of it but jan i know you mentioned that there's a lot of myths in folktales and like legends behind it so do you want to share what is one that you personally felt is one of the most populars or like something that you grew up with and it's well known around the locals because i know your experience was very different from mine growing up um so you know as a vietnamese kid who grew up in my home country i would say the most popular story regarding the moon festival is the story of tuguy so the word two here is nah you know not uncle in any sense but it's kind of like you know a young little boy called um so basically it's about this uh you know very well very polite little boy who um live alone in a poor village and one day as a reward for all the um good deeds that he has done throughout his life he found this very uh you know old but beautiful tree in the uh forest and um when he was taking the tree back to the village hoping to like sell it for an amount of money he met a guy like um i would say like a very mysterious old man not a guy and um the old man was like hey you really should you know keep that three it's gonna help you to uh bring people back from the death or cure of the illnesses in the world so he listened to the old man which is odd you know you don't listen to strangers and he kept the trees but one day he saved a rich girl from dying of um i would say it's like a heart disease or something very fatal and she became his wife however um it was also her and her i i would say like um she was not a very uh you know careful person so he um water the tree with dirty water and uh the tree ended up like flying up to the sky so wanted to keep it straight and he hold on to the roots and unfortunately um the tree pulled him up to the moon as well so now if you ever you know stand stand up on your balcony and you look at the moon you're gonna see um you know kind of like a shadow of a big tree and a boy or a man sitting under it and that but um you know i wouldn't say that you should look at the moon landing or any of those scientific video and look for but well deep in my mind you know the kids inside me still believe that koi is the only me i mean that's a really interesting story too i think it's like i i hear like some people they look at the moon they say oh like you can see the shape of the tree and him sitting under the tree like no you got all right and they like he's blowing the flute or something like that and i think one of the another variation of that story was in the beginning a tiger mom was saving her cup with the leaves and then he took it back like there was also that variation like i know there's a lot of variations of this story so for our viewers slash listeners if you had a slightly different it's we're not saying that your your version was not true or anything we're just saying we want to raise awareness that there's lots of different variations when it comes to history and culture and same with that moving forward in our episode we were we were just sharing our personal experiences and things that we thought was popular and nice to share but of course if you had a different experience in your own personal life that's obviously part of culture as well as it does vary between families and region so yeah so thank you for sharing that jang like that was like honestly a very nice story i think it's lots of kids in vietnam know about it and it's just the iconic story of the mid-autumn festival as you heard with rv music feature this song was about tango it's called hankui so it's about going to the the moon and he's lonely on the moon and like oh i wonder how he's feeling like that's what the lyrics are in the song and so that is just one of the first origins in the tradition see the reason behind the mirana festival so to answer are why do vietnamese celebrate the miranda festival first of all is to celebrate the harvest and the gathering and reunion thirdly is to celebrate jogue on the moon that's why well it's such a sad story you know like blizzard is by himself well i think there's like a fairy cold um but you know yeah yeah um there's the hanger then there's also tonga the jade rabbit yes so but that's like more of the chinese story where there's the was taken to the moon after with the nine sons and that's like the different chinese legend as well but yeah so in terms of the tradition so we know that there's this story but for you jan growing up in vietnam uh what were some of the traditions that you did in vietnam from miranda festival like could you just list a few i would say like my favorite is uh fako because it involves eating and i love mooncakes i love fruits i love all the uh you know of the sweet stuff that they offer children during the mid-autumn festival and um doing faco is one of the few occasions when i actually gather with all of my cousins like people from my extended family and uh like my grandparents would put something together for us so that we can go and snatch it just like during the month of the hungry ghost um another thing about falco is that it's gonna be paired with uh you know lanterns like showing off what lanterns your parents get you um of course you know nowadays lanterns were just for instagram pictures for me but back then i'm really like holding them around and you know playing the music in them especially like those with batteries they were so luxurious i enjoy holding them around the neighborhood and i would say when there is falco is not just something for the children it's also um an occasion for older members of the family to come together after like you know a long time of not seeing each other because of works and personal stuff another thing that um i want to talk about is actually a very spooky one um it is milan so uh melon is kind of like a spiritual act of um interacting with um kind of like a young ghost you know like the ghosts of children who die early which sound very like dreadful but um basically you're gonna offer the young ghost a little bit of rice or um you know when i used when i did it with kids in my neighborhood they even put milk in the and um whoever ends up with the uh the can because you know i have a can right here like that whoever ends up with the can running after them is gonna get caught by the melon but um the reason why you have a can following you after is because uh one of your friends who are playing with you they tie um like a you know little knots around your ankle so they can't just keep on like dragging along to a sign when you're like walking away um i wouldn't recommend this to people who are afraid of ghosts so um it's not a game for everyone but you definitely should try i think uh that one is then use the metal can like the the the condensed milk can with the long sumta right and then yeah and then they i think what the tradition was one stick of incense and then also a piece of candy right and then they had like a like a like a incantation that they would say uh and it would be like to wake up or to bring the spirit of like a kid that died with the young in in vietnam we believe that the spirits of children or babies who have died are very very strong and they're very powerful and they can hurt you a lot because they have so much positive energy in them because they have like at a very young age and they're very innocent so they have very powerful spirits out there so we never want to mess with them so it's really encouraged that you don't do it because you could actually anger like a child's spirit if you don't play with them because the whole thing is you call them up so they can play with you and there's a saying where whoever plays with them their ankles will be bruised because the can hits their ankles um but as jiang mentioned it's just like almost like a gimmick like a prank where the kids play with each other where they just tie like a string around each other's like ankles and they run and it looks like the can is chasing them but it's just like a prank but obviously you never know what the unexplained of the spiritual world as we mentioned in our previous episode don't mess with them because you never know right so aside from that was there any other like personal stories or like traditionals in this festival knowing that you grew up in vietnam so you had a different experience what were some of those that you thought were like your favorite memories aside from the ones you've already mentioned like you mentioned faco and then what else is there well i would say like my uh favorite memory of all is when i emcee for my school mid-autumn festival in grade 5. so you know from grade 5 and up i stopped celebrating moon festival with kids in my neighborhood because we are not that young anymore you know no one's going to offer us moon cakes or anything so i was celebrating at um vietnam australia international school vis my school back in vietnam and uh when i mce it is like you know the first time that i ever stood on a stage with so many people underneath and then um i also got a gift that a pair of uh ears like rabbit ears from my teachers back then because um you know i was being uh tongue up and you know when i got into public speakings i always remember my first time emceeing on stage it's kind of like shape the talkative person i am like if it wasn't for that um occasions i wouldn't be here talking to you either you know so yeah so you're saying that that was like a pivotal moment in your childhood where it just really led you to almost self-discovery but it was all thanks to this festival in some way yep for sure so did you celebrate um the moon festival at owen canada or do you just hear about it from your parents well actually here in the gta so i don't know where you were in canada but where i grew up in the gta there was a lot of the asian community nearby with my family and also with the locals and friends so what we did was obviously when you go to chinese supermarket you'd see moon cake everywhere and now it's gotten so big where you find it at costco you find it at walmart you find it at like all the western grocery stores they carry moon cake too so it's like they're part of the celebration too and in chinatown there was like the like i think there was festival sometimes and sometimes there's night markets for like the harvest festival but uh for my own family what the tradition was we'd always so like offer to the moon on the night of the full moon uh and it would be mooncakes taro tea and like fruits obviously as well as candles and since like offering well wishing for good health and like happiness and just reunited as a family and we'd also like have food cake so i i make moon cake myself at home and i also sometimes buy it but that's a tradition for me now that every year i would make a lot of the moon cake um and so that's like a recipe that's passed down from my great aunt so i like to keep it in the tradition of the family and i also there's lanterns as you can see in my background i brought these from vietnam so i wanted to bring the festival here and share because i think it's a really big part of history and tradition but it's not even an official holiday in asia like it's just like at night like you know like it's not even like a day off of work but um it's here in canada it's even harder um because it's not even like really recognized as much well not until recent years actually but it almost feels like a commercial holiday in some way i don't know if you agree with this but it kind of feels like they're just trying to sell things in some way because there's no really family gathering anymore because with all of our busy lives and society and the way things are shaped with it um it's kind of lost its original charm in some way so what do you think about this do you agree like how do you feel about this like honestly i agree with the fact that um the moon festival like any other festival and holidays were being commercialized um so you know just to compare if you look at valentine it's not just you know actually in occasions where you express your feelings for the loved one but it's it is also kind of like uh you know an occasion for chocolate shop to put things on like a higher price and uh similarly if you look at the moon festival not many children enjoy moon cakes and not many of them were allowed to have food gigs because of the parents tough diet so most of the moon cakes nowadays are just for you know gift givings to your boss or your co-workers as a note to say that like oh don't forget to help me out at work okay i'm remembering yeah you know what i mean rick and well another thing is that most of the moon festival activities including concerts and um i guess like even those that are for children are being you know so at a very high price like for the tickets entries and stuff like that and another thing that i want to say is that um you know london of the lanterns that are around you there are so many new models of them every year to attracting kids to convince their parents to kind of like you know spend money so no if you you know watch the commercials about the moon festival or if you give away mood kicks that is not like um the deepest meaning of the moon festival it is more of like commercializing it and giving marketing companies a chance to make money from it but again like festival is uh the way you celebrate it if you still choose to do it the way i do which is you know staying at home eating moon cakes and gift your boyfriend slash girlfriend if you have one nicole saying you love them then yeah it is you know still a perfect moon festival as its traditional meaning yeah i think you have a really good point there it really depends on how you celebrate it right like that's a really good point there because even as society moves forward and as people change with commercialization of things as long as your family or your personally you're choosing to keep a tradition that's all that really matters because that is what's keeping it alive and providing a tradition so like i feel like what you mentioned with like the whole lantern thing it almost feels like it's just an electronic toy now like it's just plastic now is it not and they're just battery and they have like music and things um like they're not the like these traditional style like they're folded and they put a candle in it it's more of like the battery type or sometimes they're made of printed paper now it's not even like handmade or anything anymore so i feel like that in some way also lost it's like a um like a craft was lost the whole craft behind the the traditional dengue like the star lantern that's made of cellophane and bamboo frame that is like the one of the most iconic symbols of the the miranda festival in vietnam and that is slowly disappearing because kids nowadays they play i think there was like some applications where they do an electronic like on your phone like alumni on your phone where like they hold their their smartphone and it's like the picture of a lantern and they say yeah that's your land here and there because there's no more attraction behind it because they don't hang out with their friends and especially with the way things now are everything's just kind of digital i think it's lost it's really the whole purpose and its charm in some way but uh obviously with as society becomes more modern so is there any like interesting or like crazy wacky things that you've seen like on the internet with the new modernization of this holiday like any trends anything that you think is interesting and worth trying um well speaking of trends i think we have to talk about tick tock so um recently i saw this video on making sandwich moon cake and uh well it's basically very um simple you just kind of like blend the moon kicks out uh no not the moon tanks the sandwich sorry just kind of like blend like 10 pieces of sandwich out so that they become the flowers and then you add a little bit of milk in there and then if you want you can put like food coloring but like please like do not make white moon cakes you know it's weird and uh you should go on shoppi or lazada or you know any where you can find um the how do i call this kind of like the balls yeah the mo oh yeah yeah well kind of like you find a mo for the um for the mooncake it can be raw or it can be a triangle triangular like it's totally up to you and you put the flour like the blended sandwich in and uh if you want you can put like um i would say green beans red beans or any fillings that you like inside out and then you bake it in your um air fryer oh my god air fryer yup which is a very popular items during the pandemic for about like 25 minutes and it would become a moon kick uh so i talked to some of my friends who try out a recipe and their moon kicks were you know looking ugly because it's been in the airfryer for either too long or too short so like i wouldn't recommend you doing it but um you know if anyone who is watching this success can you please send me your um like recipe or whatever that you did for your sandwich mood cake i want to find out so you mean sandwich like it's made of toast right like sliced bread yes but you have to uh blend them out you know and then put them in milk oh my god that's like really weird like with the whole it's a tick tock trend um but i think it's like one of those cool foodie trends that kind of it's like you want to try it because you're curious like is it actually gonna work or not but the whole thing about the air fryer i gotta say that's so on trend air fryer food is like one of the hottest trends right now and i'd say if you air fry moon cake that's you are 20 20 trending like that's what it is like you are relevant now so um i think another thing that i saw going around on vietnamese internet and social media was the whole thing about uh somebody was photoshopping the mooncake fillings so there was like some really crazy ones like they put cilantro or like kpop kpop artist yeah uh like do you want to eat him you know what were some of the crazy ones that you saw um like one of the worst one was uh and it's up here for the um you know 2k4 yeah 2004 kid who is going to be like going into university taking the high school exam at the end of the year so um like if you're so lost in english if you're still lost in math or physics like you should eat a piece of um feels like feelings mooncake or you know and another one is the one is that uh oh yeah lee minho he was in eternal monarch and so many of his pictures were photoshopped and moon cake fillings and they were kind of like um all over my social media because i like him too and then if you watch uh new ichi you know or then he comes off the uh like male stars or you know appear inside moon cake fillings as well so oh my god that's kind of funny you it's like i would open facebook last year and i would see the most random feelings in there and it was like the whole thing you mentioned about the testing it's like the the mindset you know when you're about to go to an exam and you take your textbook and you put it on your head it's like absorb it like except now you're eating it in the form of a mooncake but can you imagine though if they actually sold like this is physics moon cake that's a good marketing idea i should do that you know i think i need um an accounting moon kick you know what i mean oh my god it'll be like the excel spreadsheet on the mold of the wound cake and then you're like eating the knowledge inside of you so they can exhale um so on this topic now instead of like crazy feelings what is your favorite mooncake type filling like regional style and like actual filling too uh okay so you're gonna everyone might hate me for this but i seriously hate red beans and all of the mooncakes without uh you know meat and um you know like a big piece of eggs well x is always well you know um but i seriously dislike mochi fillings uh along with like all of the uh like new fillings that people keep on mixing up such as you know chocolate or vanilla or anything that is being offered at tool azure uh well i would prefer chicken or um fish fish would be okay like um you know the small pieces that were crushed yet and they mixed it with a lot of sugar and some vietnamese sausages as in like lapsion you know and it's all inside the feelings um well that is not just sweet stuff but it is also a little bit like um savory like you can actually dip it in soy sauce or fish sauce and you know you can hate me for this or you want but yeah whatever moon cakes you're eating that is mochi or um well red beans or green beans sucks oh wow okay that's a strong statement you made there you're asking for people to come against you um wait wait you like dip it in like soy sauce and like fish sauce so could you like eat it with rice technically it's like as if you're eating it with the rice because like the outside layers is already carbs so you have carb and you have protein in ba you can have it for breakfast but i'll like put it in the oh my gosh airfryer yeah oh my god the airfryer again yeah you can i think uh that that would be assorted so the one you're mentioning is like different types of top gum right like the assorted ones yes those ones right those i find that they're always like kind of expensive like um i've seen some of them when i was in vietnam i would see they would be like baongu yika like abalone and like shark fin like in the moon cake and for those viewers or listeners who haven't heard about this before it's not like it's not like full-on like meat or like whatever in there it's candied so like jang mentioned like it's mixed with a lot of syrup uh sesame seeds sometimes nuts like cashews almonds and different things and they mix it together into a melange and then it's like a candied block and then they put it into the skin and then they bake the skin um and that would be the actual mood cake it's the assorted one or i think some people called the five kernel one here but in vietnam there's some bakeries like the specialty ones too really really fancy ones and i think sometimes it's a single moon cake can go up to 20 to thirty dollars like just one yeah because it has like so many expensive ingredients in there like there's some of them that have the traditional herbal medic medicine like um easter medication like um ginseng and like uh the mushrooms shiitake mushrooms ginger and like all those really expensive things i think there's sea cucumber in some of them too and it's just really extravagant in so many different ways but i was always questioning is that even gonna taste good like that's not even a dessert anymore i can't even like but that would be definitely something that you want to get for your boss it's expensive it shows you're classy it's like showing your it's almost in some way where now there's a level of prestige with the ranks of moon cakes i don't know if you notice that um where like the regular like lower brand yeah the box and also the actual filling too and how many egg yolks how many salted duck egg yolks are in there um sometimes there's eight in there like i've seen like the big one there's eight salted duck eggs in there um and like there's like the regular brands like gundo or like um uh and then there's like the more higher end ones like hila mom yeah or like those like specialty bakery ins there and then in vietnam there's also the coffee shops also all have moon cakes so starbucks uh plum cafe a coffee house um what else is there it's not gut fell don't try it really it's not good because they don't have uh you know fish or meat or oh okay that's why because okay yeah that's not the majority just um have you had the oreo moon cake before i know that's going around in vietnam a lot the oreo one yep i actually try it at um my mom's friend's house when she offer it and it doesn't taste very good because again like i don't like the way you know they mix uh foreign flavors and to an asian cuisines like you know cuisines are koshers like please do not mix them too much it might not taste good and another thing is that you know if you eat an oreo the cookie is gonna make up for the sweetness of uh like the cream at the um you know at the middle but since it is a moon cake like everything is just so sweet it's kind of like eating two spoon of sugar oh my god yeah i can imagine that's does it taste like a blunt up oreo except with so much extra like cream and sugar is that what it looks like exactly what it is oh gosh well i guess for based out at um you know your place like in canada no i think there's people who bring it over from overseas like as like carry-ons like and they sell it right it's like hank sata you know you're gonna have money to buy that's and it's like you could probably order it and have it shipped here but see hearing this it's probably not worth it um they would probably charge you like 50 plus dollars to get it here so that was one of the things i wanted to try when i was in vietnam but i didn't get a chance to um next time i will but uh kind of like it's one of those things where you just want to try for the sake of trying it you know like it's you gotta try it once in your life you know um but you know what for our listeners and viewers if you saw that going around on the internet the oreo moon cake is not worth it if you do not like eating two spoons of sugar psa for everybody okay so knowing how you were in canada for a few years so how was your experience living abroad when it came to the time of this festival like how did it make you feel like what was your mindset and how like what were your emotions basically and was your experience living overseas during this like during this festival well like during my time in canada i actually did not um feel many moon festival vibe similarly to tech because people do not celebrate them like of course when i was living with my uh relative family i felt you know a little bit when they i felt it a little bit when they uh brought home some mood kicks and stuff but uh when i asked my friend at school about this festival not many of them know about it but you know my korean friends take this festival very seriously i guess it's because of her culture so we actually went to um central you know guys if you live in newmarket or aurora area there is a sentra you should uberva or buzzwear i don't know but they sell very good moon carricks and they do not have even though they do not have the feelings that i like but you know at least you can have a piece of moon cake and call it the moon festival so i think honestly overseas it's so hard to get that festival feeling and you don't really have it because none of your neighbors are celebrating it you don't go out because i know in vietnam like if you live in the alley in the hymn you open your door and you would see like all the kids like playing or like you would have like everybody like gathering you'd see every household that have like a gathering and a family get together and it just felt warm and like as if you're all together and it felt like even though you were so far apart you came together for this one thing and you were so like you are together for the like to represent like the full moon which is why there are so many like symbolic items in the moon festival that represent togetherness first of all being the full moon being the brightest being the most warm everybody's together to represent that and then there's also the moon cakes that round represent togetherness the egg yolk filling is also round to represent togetherness and the traditional lanterns some of them around too and there's also the hot pot i think some people eat hot pot right during the moon festival a lot because first of all that's a activity that you have to do together with your family or as a group so you're already together and the round pot once again represents the togetherness because you typically eat it at a circle table so there's a lot of symbolic items around this festival that i think are really important and really nice to share with the future generations or even just people who are not within our community and to share the culture and have cultural appreciation um for each other um so yeah that's one of the things that i thought was really nice that i wanted to share but i hopefully one day they can bring and make more of a importance here in canada yeah is there any traditions that you feel that you want to really preserve or keep and or like have it brought over here in canada um i would say the number one tradition is to have a faco you know if i ever raise my kids in the future in canada i would like them to experience go at some points and um you know i would always do hot pot during the moon festival like i really like to you know inform people from different cultures of my culture that is the biggest reason why i joined the culture team uh and also you know i wouldn't recommend trying melon but i would love to see um bazaar doing it together without me next year um yeah when the pandemic is over and we can go on campus and do that you know but without me i'm not trying i'm not you know joining i'm just watching you know what let's not mess with the spirits um there's a lot of stories going on campus but uh if you're on campus you know what i'm talking about um but if not then let's not mess with the spiritual world because you never know when you might anger them uh that's a good psa don't mess with the spirit world as i said in the previous episode um but yeah i do agree that those are really nice traditions that we can hopefully bring here one day and it's unfortunate that this year in vietnam the panamic you cannot do it and enjoy it even though you're in vietnam because it would have been nice if you were able to share your experiences with us through our social media platforms with your experiences but of course safety first um i hope that everybody is staying safe and as i said in our last episode hopefully in the next episode we'll be in the studio but as you
