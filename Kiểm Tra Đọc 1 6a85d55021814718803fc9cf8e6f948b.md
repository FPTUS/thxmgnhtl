**Safety and Health**

Volunteers are responsible for their own personal safety and should notify the school of any pre-existing medical conditions. Prescription and any other medications that you normally carry with you must be handed in to the school nurse on arrival and collected on departure. If you require them, the nurse will dispense them to you in her office.

**Sign-in**

A sign-in book is located at office reception. Please sign this register every time you come to the school. This is important for insurance purposes and emergency situations.
After signing the book, collect a Visitor‚Äôs badge from the office. This must be worn at all times when you are on school premises. Remember to return the badge afterwards.

**Messages**

Teachers will communicate with volunteers via telephone, email or messages left at the office. Always ask for messages. You may communicate with teachers in the same way ‚Äì the preferred method is to leave a memo in the relevant teacher‚Äôs pigeonhole.¬† These can be found at the end of the corridor in the staffroom block.

**Work hours**

We understand that your time commitment is entirely voluntary and therefore flexible. If your personal schedule should change and this affects your availability, please contact the Co-ordinator for Volunteers at the school on extension 402; alternatively, you could drop in to her office situated in F block.

# Camping in the Bush

**Minimal impact bushwalking**

Responsible campers observe minimal impact bushwalking practices. This is a code of ethics and behaviour aimed at preserving the natural beauty of bushwalking areas.

**Planning**

Good planning is the key to safe and successful camping trips. Obtaining a camping permit in advance of leaving to camp out overnight in a national park is obligatory. Bookings are also compulsory for some parks. There could be limits on group sizes in some parks. Occasionally campsites may be closed owing to bushfire danger or for other reasons. Always obtain permission from the owner prior to crossing private property.

**Equipment**

As well as your usual bushwalking gear, you will need the right equipment for camping.
A fuel stove and fuel for cooking is essential: not only is it safer, faster and cleaner; but it is easier to use in wet weather. It is recommended that you pitch a free-standing tent which requires few pegs and therefore has less ecological impact. Take a sleeping mat, if you have one, to put your sleeping bag on for a more comfortable night‚Äôs sleep. You will also need a hand trowel to bury human waste ‚Äì for proper sanitation and hygiene.

**Campfires**

The traditional campfire actually causes a huge amount of environmental damage. If you gather firewood, you are removing the vital habitat of insects, reptiles, birds and small mammals. When campfires lead to bushfires, they create enormous danger to native bush inhabitants and bushwalkers alike and result in destruction of the environment. Under no circumstances should you light a fire in the bush.

**Campsites**

Erect your tent at an existing site if possible; otherwise try to find a spot where you won‚Äôt damage vegetation. Never cut branches or move rocks or disturb the soil unnecessarily. Aim to leave your campsite as you found it or even cleaner.

**Rubbish**

Remove all rubbish ‚Äì carry it out with you. Don‚Äôt attempt to burn or bury rubbish because this creates a fire hazard and/or disturbs the soil. Animals can dig up buried rubbish and scatter it about. Never feed the local wildlife ‚Äì carry out all food scraps as these disturb the natural nutrient balance and can create weed problems.

**Walk safely**

Keep on the track. Wear footwear suitable for the terrain. Take a map.
