# Geography

**Finland** is part of **Scandinavia**, a geographical region in northern Europe, and shares land **borders** with Norway, Sweden, and Russia. **The Baltic Sea** borders the country to the south and southwest. The **coastline** in this part of the country is speckled with nearly 180,000 small **islands**. Finland’s remote northern **province**, known as Lapland, sits above the Arctic Circle.

The Finnish **landscape** is mostly **flat**, though the Scandinavian Mountains stretch into the northwestern part of the country. Finland is heavily forested, with over 70 percent of the country covered by thick **woodlands**. Called “land of a thousand lakes,” Finland actually has 187,888 of them.

A **majority** of the people living in Finland were born and raised in the country, and nearly 90 percent of the population speaks **Finnish**. Finland is also home to the Sami, a herding people once known as the Lapps. They live in Lapland, where they herd **reindeer.**

Many Finnish cultural customs reflect its forested landscape. While other European cultures historically viewed forests as dark and **threatening**, the Finns see forests as places of **shelter** and adventure. Today, many Finns have second homes in the woods to escape city life.

Another popular Finnish tradition is taking a **sauna**—steaming in a **superheated** room—and then jumping into an icy lake. The country of some five million people is home to about 1.5 million saunas. Much of the population has saunas in their home, and many big companies have saunas for their employees. Finnish saunas are almost always constructed with wood from **birch trees**.

Finns pride themselves as being the global capital of **heavy metal music**. They boast more than 50 metal bands per 100,000 people—that’s more metal bands per person than any other country in the world. The country hosts a number of metal music festivals every year, mostly during the summer.
