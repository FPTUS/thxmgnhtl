- **Ph·ª• ƒë·ªÅ**
    
    Hello, and welcome to the first episode of deeply curious, we are starting this podcast because it is, was highly requested by you guys, if this is your first time hearing or seeing us, my name is Cody Jensen, and this is my wife, Sarah. And we started this podcast or are starting this podcast right now. Because we kind of had the idea, we pitched it to our vlog viewers, and you guys overwhelmingly said, Absolutely, yes, please do it. So we're here right now. Doing it. Yep. Um, so this is gonna be something that we are going to be figuring out the format and testing trial and error, trying to figure out what's the best way to do this. But to start, I just want to tell you kind of why we're starting this podcast, we mentioned it in the vlog that we kind of talked to our YouTube audience about it. But if you didn't see that, I just want to kind of give you a backstory of why we're doing this. So we have these conversations all the time. We are very curious people and introspective. And I don't know, we just like thinking about stuff. And so here's how most of time it starts. So I was listening to this podcast, or I'm reading this book, or something like that article on Twitter. Yes. So that's how most of the conversations start. And then I share some random thing that interests me about some podcasts listened to or line out of a book or something like that. So that is basically the start of most of those conversations, just us consuming some sort of content, enjoying it, making us think about something and then sharing it with each other. And then that goes into sitting there talking about all sorts of different topics for a long time. And that is kind of what we do on our blog as well, in a edited format, a lot of it gets cut for time. That's actually another name that I haven't thought about for this podcast was to call it cut for time, because we just, that's kind of the catalyst that kind of was driving us towards this direction. But all the conversations tend to be about these things we are deeply curious about. So that's what we're going with. And so we have these conversations on the blog, and a lot of it gets cut out. And so we wanted to maybe explore this podcast format, because it's obviously longer form, you don't have to actually watch it. If you are watching. Hello, thank you for watching the video on YouTube. But you're just listening. This is something that you can do on your way to work doing the dishes, whatever. It just, I don't know, we're just exploring.
    
    Yeah, I mean, I think it just gives us an opportunity to talk more with you guys about what we're interested in.
    
    Yeah, so something that may not always be at the front of the show. But I'm gonna start this kind of first one. So as we get into the groove, we kind of get some conversations going. But one thing we want to do in every podcast is let you guys know that this show this, I guess show is what we call it is sponsored by the things that we love. And the things that we love this week for me is last night, we watched this documentary on Amazon Prime, and it's called human flow. And it was all about immigration and about refugees. And so it was mostly leaning more on the refugee side. But it also was talking about immigration as well. And I loved this documentary, it's beautiful. I thought the the way they shot it was so raw, but then also beautiful. But then the story was very open ended. It was I
    
    mean, because we're living it right now, like the refugee crisis is still very much a crisis. And so there there is no ending there is no answers. There's just a lot of questions and a lot of like, what do we do with all of these people who deserve to have a home? You know, I think that's why there is no answer that it's still open. We're still living it.
    
    I wanted to start the podcast with just talking about this just because we haven't talked about it yet. We watched it last night and they went to bed. So it seemed like a good conversation starter. And if you guys want to watch this documentary, it is on amazon prime. So if you have Amazon Prime, you can just watch it for free. If you don't, you can sign up for a 14 day free trial of Amazon prime by just going to prime dot Cody [johnson.com](http://johnson.com/) And if you sign up for the Free Trial, you can watch this documentary. It's called human flow. But I wanted to ask, which I mean, we haven't talked about it. So what do you think about it?
    
    Um, I thought it was absolutely beautiful. Just like cinematography, I thought was really great. And like, it gave space to breathe. Like, there wasn't anything, you know, major about, I guess the cinematography, but it just shows you like the shots and let you sit there in the shot for a long time, which was really nice. And I loved how they visited so many different places. It wasn't just like about the Syrian refugees, although that was a major part. It wasn't just about Iraq, or Pakistan, or whatever they included, like the African refugee crisis, which I didn't even. I mean, we haven't really even spoken about, like in American media, I was super aware of it. So I love that. And I mean, I think just the whole conversation of refugees and immigrants, and just the fact that they are human beings and have certain human rights that they aren't receiving is just a very important conversation. And I mean, I don't obviously they're not receiving certain rights, because the countries they have escaped to don't have the means to provide. And then obviously, there are some countries who are choosing not to help, which is another conversation. Yeah, I think it just covered all conversations, and like you said, was very open ended. So it like, asked the questions or like presented the issue, and then it's just like, Okay, what now? You know,
    
    I felt like it presented the issue in a very VICE News type way. Where there was almost no, actually there was no commentary. There was all it was, was showing you, the places and the people. And only in the people only talk sometimes. It was mostly you just got to witness what it was. And then I guess the only commentary would be that they put on screen headlines from that time.
    
    Yeah. And they interviewed like, representatives of certain humanitarian organizations or immigration refugee crisis. People, I don't know what their titles were. But so I guess that's commentary as well, just about, like, what they're going through, or what we need to do in order to to help them kind of thing. But again, it wasn't a solution. It was just like, this is the problem.
    
    I think, the one of the parts that struck me the most, and I know it did you too, because I think we both like said something right in the moment was whenever they showed the tiger. Yeah. So they were in the Gaza Strip. And they opened with a shot of this tiger, beautiful shot. And I was kind of like, why are they showing this? Because they just like it was a long shot of just seconds of just watching a tiger in a cage. Yeah. And I was like, I wonder like, what are they showing this for? But then the guy starts telling the story. And this tiger had somehow found its way into Gaza through the tunnels
    
    of Egypt. I think they said, Yeah, he was like, running away from bombs and whatever, and found his way into Gaza, which wasn't really any better. Yeah.
    
    But he was trapped in Gaza at that point. And there was some individual or group of people that felt that this tiger deserved a better life than being in a cage in Gaza,
    
    right? Because he never got to see the grass. Oh, one person came by every 15 days to make sure he had food. And of course, all of the bombs and the like, animals weren't meant to live in that kind of traumatic environment.
    
    Yeah. And so they, they were talking about that, and then they, the guy was telling the story. And he said that this tiger, everybody agreed it didn't deserve to live in these conditions. And so like, I don't know, governmental
    
    military, from multiple countries at in Gaza, outside of Gaza, transportation, V says, all sorts of paperwork. I mean, he listed like 10 things that they
    
    it was it was four or five different countries who all worked together to make sure that this tiger was transported and delivered to a better life with better resources. Yeah. And I just kind of left it at that because that it was just everybody working together in agreement that this tiger deserved better deserves better, and yet they were taking it from Gaza.
    
    Right where people can't leave like the people are in Gaza aren't getting better treatment than or even being funded to ship or to fly to a new place.
    
    It is like I think there's even one of the guys in the documentary said, it is a third world country on the verge of collapse. And no one's there to help the people, but they're all willing to get everything together to help a tiger. Mm hmm.
    
    Crazy. Yeah, it was, it was crazy. I think that's just an interesting, I mean, cuz I obviously agree that Tiger is not meant to live like that. But, I mean, you have to kind of say like, Well, why are we allowing people to live like that? You know, why is that a thing? Yeah, it's crazy.
    
    So that's going to be my what I love this week. Again, if you want to watch it, it's called human flow. It's a I didn't mention, it's actually a documentary from Iowa way. He's the one who made it. And if you've been watching our blogs, I've talked about Ioway a couple times, because he just did a big art installation in New York City. That is, it was all over there was like, I don't even know how many pieces there were but five, at least five really big pieces in Washington Square Park in Central Park. And then all around the Lower East Side specifically, it was called Good fences make good neighbors, and it was a commentary on immigration. And it went right along with with a documentary that he made called human flow. So highly recommend checking that out on Amazon Prime. And if you don't have it, you can still watch it for free by signing up for a 14 day free trial at prime dot Cody [johnson.com](http://johnson.com/). What's something that you've loved? This week?
    
    I'm reading this book right now called You Are a badass by Jensen. cero. And it? I mean, I'm sure most people have heard about this book. I've never heard of it. You haven't? No. Oh, it's a very highly rated like self help book. But it's kind of a no nonsense. And so she's just kind of blunt. And I mean, it's called You Are a badass. Like, she's kind of, you know, it's just very practical and very applicable. I guess it's like, easily applicable to your life. And just kind of, I don't know, she calls out some, maybe ways of thinking that we've all been taught that are hindering us. And so, yeah, it's really
    
    great. So one thing that we were talking about before we press record was trying to figure out how to do this podcast in the same natural way that we do when we are sitting at Starbucks talking. Because, you know, when we're sitting there, we're just like, staring out the window or whatever. And then like, we start talking about something which sparks something else,
    
    we're like silent for, like, 20 minutes. And they're like, what's the difference between insecurity and humility?
    
    Exactly. So it's like, when we turn, you know, press record on the microphone and press record on the cameras, it's like, okay, now do this. And it's, we basically, we're figuring this out as as we go. So, hopefully, this doesn't feel forced or boring, boring or anything like that, you know, a conversation that we were having the other day, cuz you you're reading a new book, about introversion, and it really struck a chord with you. More nerve, I would say even more than a chord.
    
    Yeah. Probably. Well, let me grab the book, because I don't want to quote it wrong. I actually posted something along these lines on my Facebook, and I have a friend who studied this. I think she's a psychologist, but I could be wrong. She's a counselor of some sort. Anyways, she commented on my Facebook, and explained to me that I'm wrong a little bit in my thinking, but we haven't had a chance to connect and like talk about it. So I just will share the few things that irritate me. And then kind of talk about, or I'll let you know, like what she said about it, I guess. Um, so I'm reading this book called introvert power by Laurie HELCO. And she is a psychologist and counselor, etc. I don't really know how they labeled themselves anyways, she wrote this book, because if you guys didn't know, over 50% of the population is introverted. I think it's like 50 or 53%, or 57%. And then the 40, whatever percent are extroverted. So there's actually more introverts than there are extroverts in the population, but for some reason, we value extraversion. And not I wouldn't say we don't just value it, but we sort of elevate it above introversion, and it's sort of become our society's like standard. And like if you're not this, then something's wrong with you. kind of thing. And she's talking about that in the first chapters of this book. And she was saying in the APA, which is the American Psychiatric Association, they were preparing the fifth revision of its DSM Manual of Mental Disorders and things like that. And they tried to include introversion as like mental or they tried to use introversion to define or prescribe some mental disorders. And they tried to include a diagnosis for introverted personality disorder into their manual. So they were basically saying that introverted personality is a disorder instead of like a preference. And then through the ICD, which is a different book that includes not just mental disorders, but all kinds of diagnoseable diseases. They tried to include, I know they have included in the most current version, the 2012 version, it's still in there, they included introversion, which is listed as a variant of schizoid personality disorder, which is the thing that really gets me Yeah. And then she also talked about how we use the term in society, we use the term antisocial to describe introverts. But actually, the term antisocial refers to sociopathy or antisocial personality disorder, which is a condition in which a person lacks a social conscience. If she said, if we're getting like into semantics here, what you would actually say is a social, which is someone who does not like to interact with people, but that's also not introverts. And so she was just talking about how there are some misconceptions about introversion. And my friend commented on my Facebook, she said, basically, that it's not that in those books, it's not that introversion is seen as a disease or a mental disorder. But depending on what the person is saying about like, I have a hard time going out at night bla bla bla, then they kind of use that as a measure to figure out what's actually wrong kind of thing, I guess, I don't know, we haven't had a chance to talk about it yet. But I told her, I was like, here's the thing. When books are, you know, as a society, we sort of devalue introversion and use all of these negative terms to describe introversion. And those health books seem to be supporting that. And that is what gets me also, a variant of schizoid personality disorder just seems like a little harsh.
    
    Yeah, I think is like, maybe it's just about semantics and right, but I think semantics do play into a stereotype, right? That if you have medical professionals who are using the word introvert, in a medical sense of diagnosing somebody with a problem, right to diagnose, it adds to the stereotype that introversion is a negative, right, which
    
    I think her and I are both on the same page, my friend and I are both because I said my concern, really, as a person who hasn't studied this in school, who isn't a psychologist, but who is an introvert, and who is curious like about these kinds of things. I it concerns me that they would describe it like that, because it gives society an excuse to call it like a sickness, which they do, and it or
    
    the introvert should try to change them. So that can be an extrovert,
    
    right, which is, I mean, pretty much how our world is run. There's I mean, articles everywhere. And even in this book, introvert power, Laurie was talking about how they ran this test on extroverts and introverts, and they told both of them to act extroverted and used synonyms, like bold, brave, assertive, adventurous, talkative, you know, everything that we view as positive. And then they did the opposite and said to act introverted, and they used words like lethargic, reserved, an adventurous, quiet, you know, all these words that are just negations of extraversion instead of their own words, like, as she said, If we flip that, and instead of saying like introverts are the negation of extraversion, maybe extraversion is the negation of introversion, and if we did that, then it would be if we told them to act extroverted, we would say act loud, act on introspective on reserve, you know, opposites of introversion and it makes it sound like an extrovert is,
    
    so act loud and obnoxious. Exactly. And without the thought of yourself or others
    
    Exactly. And so she's saying, Why are we viewing introversion as a negation of extraversion? Because it's literally just the way someone reflects and gains energy is by do they look outward? Or do they look inward? Mm hmm. That's it. It's not about anything else. And so, I don't know, I think it's fascinating. And it also frustrates me a little bit, because I do think like society views introversion as a less than, and even in a lot of classically introverted work, like writing, we are now expected to be able to go public speak about the book that we just wrote, or, you know, go on radio shows, and news interviews and all of these things, even though you right, because it's like traditionally an introverted line of work. But now we're expected to build platforms and to have a following and to be out and open. And there. You mentioned
    
    just now, right there, but I think maybe we'll expound on a little bit for just because I think that we in the misconception, there's a lot of people who don't know, what an introvert and extrovert is, they do think of it as we were just describing as somebody who is a wallflower. And somebody who is the life of the party. That's the difference between an introvert and extrovert. But those qualities can be applied to both introverts and extroverts, right? It's what I maybe you have a better definition than me. But I have always, I've kind of been told that in the most simplistic form. A introvert is somebody who, at the end of the day, the way that they recharge, the way that they gain energy is through being in more solo environments. And it doesn't necessarily have to be by themselves, but in a, in a smaller environment in a quieter environment, where it's more introspective, then somebody who's an extrovert, who, at the end of the day, you know, they get energy and recharge by being around more people, larger groups. And basically, that is it is just do, how are you energized whenever you go to a party, and introvert and extrovert can have the same level of enjoyment at a party, but when they leave, the extrovert is going to leave feeling like, I want to go do that again right now. Versus the introvert is going to be like, that was really fun. I needed a few moments to myself.
    
    Yeah, I think that's generally speaking. That's it. I think that the thing is that extraversion is more apparent, because it's outward qualities. And introversion is more inward quality. So like introspection, you, you look inward to figure out life, I guess. Whereas like extraversion, they look outward, they immediately want to talk to somebody about it, they need to like brainstorm with people and like figure ideas out and introversion is a that's very possible. I love like brainstorming with friends, or like a few close friends. But I'm very, I very much like, like my space, and I go into my head. And I think about it before I speak it. So I think it's just, it's basically Yes, that's it, like an introvert can be the life of the party. 100% And I also think everyone is on a scale, which I I mean, most of the time we're generally speaking so you kind of have to generalize everything, but everyone is on a scale. Everyone is all introvert. All all extrovert, they're somewhere in the middle. No, I mean, there are hardly anybody who is 100% extrovert or 100% introvert and I also I think you can be more introverted and extroverted depending on what season of life you're in.
    
    I feel that a lot.
    
    I mean, I think it's very possible. Yeah, because
    
    I mean, for me, in in in every test I've ever taken about being introvert or extrovert, I've pretty much always come out as an ambivert which is somebody who is equal parts introverted and extroverted. Yes. And I think that's maybe why I feel it more than what you do it because I since I am such an in the middle and there are some seasons of my life that I feel I have kind of swung towards extroverted pneus or swung towards introverted pneus in in the way that how I'm energized I think another interesting like thing to think about that many people don't, wouldn't really from the outside. I don't think a lot of people would he would look at me and say he's an introvert. No, I think most people would say you're extroverted and I am but I'm not full on extroverted like whenever I am in a smaller group Have you know 15 or less like more so around 10 Like, I will be the life of the party type person like and you can drive the conversation, I can command a room and all that type of stuff. But then whenever it gets into a larger group of people, like we go to like a networking party or just a larger situation, I recluse the other way, I guess, like, I have a lot, it depends on the day. But I would say more often than not, I feel awkward and I don't know who to talk to. Or it's, it's more difficult for me. Yeah. versus in a smaller group.
    
    Which is unfortunate for me, because I'm always awkward no matter what size of the group and I'm supposed to be able to depend on you to be my security at parties. And it doesn't happen.
    
    i It also changes a lot whenever I like, mentally prepare for it. Yeah, like, if I just walk in without ever thinking about it, I tend to be more awkward. But if I walk in preparing my brain, I guess like before, I'm just like, Okay, be confident. Well, that's
    
    an extroverted trait. Yeah. Introverts typically do not do well with spontaneous changes of events, unless, of course, they're canceled plans. But if it's like, your friend is like, Hey, let's go to dinner. Oh, by the way, I invited 12 People like that is not I mean, no. You have to. Introverts really need like the space to prepare to socialize. It's not because they don't want to socialize. It's just exhausting to them. Which sounds bad, but it's not bad. It's just, it just takes all of their energy. So they have to, they have to prepare it. That's it.
    
    Yeah. I think a really good example of this is Sarah versus our friend Josh, who he's like, straight up extrovert. So extrovert, and I'm sure Josh, you're listening this I just want to say I'm assuming Oh, yeah. But he is when I was an extrovert.
    
    I have a prime example. Can I just share? Yeah. So um, when we were living in Tulsa, Josh had to travel for work. He went to Singapore. And he was in Singapore for like, seven or eight days on his own. And he, it was one Sunday morning, Cody was working. And he texted me. He was like, Hey, are you awake? I said, Yeah, I'm up. He was like, good. I was waiting for you to wake up. I haven't spoken to anybody in three days. I was like, This sounds like heaven. You're traveling on your own in a foreign country. And he just like could not handle it he had. So we like texted for like an hour, because he just needed human interaction.
    
    Yeah, the reason I brought him up was because whenever it comes to Sarah, like if she is working on something, let's say she's writing a blog post, she wants to be more so by herself, and in an environment that is quieter. Versus Josh, he writes as well. But he would love to have tons of people around him.
    
    Yeah, like he used to come over to our house to write whereas I have to go away from anybody I know. But I think it's, again, it's how people process I process things internally, he processes by bouncing ideas and brainstorming and you know, just like gathering energy from people, and I'm just the opposite.
    
    I think an interesting like, the thing that I think most people be surprised about, which is that most YouTubers are introverts.
    
    Actually, I don't remember what study it was, or even who did it, but they have talked about this a lot that the internet is basically a goldmine for introverts, because it gives them the ability to have these conversations without the kind of awkwardness or uncomfortable pneus of face to face. Not that again, introverts don't want to see your face or don't want to socialize, but it just kind of breaks down that barrier and gives them like an entry into conversations with people. But yeah, most a lot of YouTubers are introverted. A lot of public speakers are introverted. A lot of leaders like it, generally speaking, a lot of leaders or very prominent important people are introverts.
    
    It just plays to that strength of, of the introspection. And it's just interesting, like, because if you were to take somebody like Casey Neistat, who comes across as somebody who is like, extroverted, like right, every very excited every trait that you would typically say like is an extroverted trait you would attribute to Casey, but I think in reality off camera in a regular life, he's way more an introvert.
    
    I agree. I think he said that before, too. Yeah. The thing is, there's a book quiet by Susan Cain, which is also about introversion and it's fantastic if you haven't read it, and she talks about that she said introverts are capable of adopting extroverted traits for work they love but that's the thing is like introverts can learn how to be extroverted for a time, it's not. It's not like introverts are even. I know, but there's just not another word to describe it. And that is this. That's introverts powers, that's her whole thing. But the thing is, is that we are capable of performing and outperforming extroverts if we want to. The thing is, is that we, we have to turn to ourselves or back inward afterwards in order to create those things that we love so much. I mean, it's, it's why most writers are introverts because they can look inward and like think about things really deeply, and then share it. It's why most YouTubers are introverts, they sit at home, and they're creating something and they don't need, you know, all of the stimulants that extroverts need. Like, that's the thing is like introverts are very easily overstimulated by noise by people by smells by everything. Again, we're generalizing here, but they don't need all of the stimulants that extroverts need. So they can sit at home longer and create something, and then they are capable of going out and sharing that. I think it's interesting because again maybe it is all comes back to semantics in that this the words introvert and extrovert have been used way too broadly because I would also do you know what the what introvert action means like if you broke it down into the definition of like intra and then burped like what that means well I don't either but that it was curious to me but just I was just thinking that to call somebody introvert and have all of these traits it's just maybe too broad of a word and the fact that like introvert I feel like maybe should just be attributed to the way that that person charges well originally that's what it was versus somebody who is shy right because shyness is not introversion right extroverts are very capable of being shy introverts are very capable of being bold and assertive I think that's the thing is that they used to be I mean Carl Jung is like kind of the pioneer of extraversion and introversion and that's literally all they were they were definitions of you know how a person recharges or whatever you want to say they look outward they look inward pretty much it and obviously like they have like different traits like introspection verse versus you know whatever but I think Society has just decided and I don't even know how or when or why but they just decided that we need to be extroverts and I also wonder if that's more of an American thing versus other countries because America very much values like hustle and busyness and hard work and being seen and just like you know more more and more so I think it might also be like an American versus other countries situation too I think I don't know I just looked up the the Latin is where it came from introvert most things do come so intro to the inside and revertere is to turn so basically it means to turn inward or to turn outward yeah but then the actual like the dictionary definition that comes up is introvert a shy reticent rat reticent reticent I don't know what that means we need a dictionary to look up the dictionary definition but the point is is that the dictionary the use of the word shy is incorrect yes because shy is not does not is not synonymous with introversion Oh Shia LeBouf has done tons of things that like been crowds gone to parties he's just done it yeah Cheyenne LeBouf so the thing is is like I just think regardless of you know what the APA or the ICD or whatever regardless of what they use to diagnose certain disorders regardless of how you feel about that introversion is viewed negatively in our society and I think that is the problem because there's literally nothing wrong with it and introverts are very capable of performing and outperforming just like anybody else and I mean a lot of people are using the myers-briggs test now which obviously like the e or the eye on the myers-briggs is extraversion and introversion that's a big part of it but they're using the myers-briggs to determine like who to hire which whatever that isn't a whole other conversation but people are becoming like resistant to personality tests and they're becoming ashamed of what their type is because businesses are viewing it as a positive or a negative personality type and I just don't understand that I don't understand if you are looking to hire this person and their result comes back is TP or whatever and they're like oh we need to think about this cuz maybe they can't actually like do well on presentations right like screw that like that's not what that means at all yeah and it's not to put you inside a box right is to help you be so aware enough so that you can overcome your what do you call it like the the shadow side well nuts should in in regular language though I mean just like the I would say just your weakness yes yes to like it's just overcome your weaknesses yeah it's to help you learn how to be a more rounded developed right healthy weren't you telling me a story I feel like it was you that you told me a story of a guy who worked at a company for like years and he was doing like really well it wasn't me it was a podcast yeah yeah and then they the company made them take the myers-briggs test right and he his result came back infj and which is my personality type so um by experience yeah I feel you don't put me in a box unless you're in my box and then we can hang out yeah so true I will do what I want when I want it anyways he got back these test results infj and immediately his company started kind of second-guessing his work and sort of re-evaluating what he's doing his coworkers I wouldn't say made fun of them but like viewed him differently yeah and he resented the fact that he was an infj which is so heartbreaking in a lot of ways because one he was doing phenomenally well and his work was outstanding and he was moving on he was moving up and just because he got a certain result in the company tested everybody right and then they learned what all these things meant and then they viewed him differently right and so he no like I either I don't remember if he like got fired or done but he definitely did got passed over for the things that he was working towards which is frustrating because I mean that's that's not the point of personality test and he came to resent personality test and who he is you know and that's just frustrating that's that's not the point at all so I think that as a society we just need to change the way we view things and people and like quit thinking that one is better than the other I think that one thing you said a little bit ago reminded me like you just talked about the the ashamed of it mm-hmm and I think that's kind of almost the whole conversation of that we have to flip the narrative on kind of what you were saying that Laurie was saying in that book just that we can't describe introverted qualities as the antithesis of extroverted qualities right you have to give them their own qualities right and if you are an introvert and you're thinking oh man I wish I was an extrovert I wish I could do all these things it's not about like being ashamed of being an introvert I think it has to be the way to change is to embrace it and say that these this is Who I am right and just like with all self-awareness it comes with saying this is who I am and so these are the things that I'm going to struggle with and these are the things that I'm gonna excel with but it doesn't mean they either one of them shouldn't be done right it's just now you know okay if I want to do something that seems daunting for you public speaking let's say mmm that just it seems you know I I want to do this it's gonna be a little bit harder for me right but you know yourself well enough to take the steps necessary in order to write you've overcome here for longer or you sit down and you write out a speech word-for-word or you think of I don't know something to reward you with afterwards like maybe after you public speak you get to go rent a hotel room by yourself you know something else I think is just again like you said you're getting aware of of your qualities your strengths and your weaknesses and and what you need to do to enhance and come back to both of those I think that is more on a like the micro level but I was kind of more speaking on a I wouldn't my example ended up going more micro but I was speaking more on a macro that just the introversion as a whole needs a rebranding yes it does and I think that it just takes people stepping up and saying proudly right I'm an introvert and also it has nothing it's not even about demeaning extraversion you know we both introverts and extroverts complement each other mm-hmm and I think that's the point right like when I walk into some sort of party and I'm on my own and I don't know anybody I'm literally the most terrified I could ever be in my entire life I I cannot approach a person or even if I've seen them before I'm like what do I say though like I can't do it um and there's actually happened to me like I don't know a week or two ago I posted it on my Twitter because somebody walked up to me mm-hmm and I said hey who are you I haven't seen you before I said oh I'm Sarah and they're like oh I'm Courtney and we had this whole conversation it was really great and I felt comfortable but it's because somebody approached me it's not that I don't want to talk to them I just don't know how to approach them right so like and it was a great conversation which I think that right there it goes into another stereotype that a lot of introverts get because in those moments you have a really hard time of stepping out and starting the conversation they think you're a snob right you end up being labeled yes stuck-up a snob a you know whatever it is to talk to me very much and really it's just like I wish I could talk to you I'm just so terrified yeah yeah and it's true and I just think extroverts and introverts complement each other and one is not better than the other and in fact I very much appreciate extroverts because of that situation or I love going to events with an extroverted friend for that reason because I can't introduce myself to people no matter how hard I try I just feel and act and come across like such an idiot like I can't speak and I don't know how to how to react I don't know if you can see this and you can if you're listening to but I can see Sarah's why's this got a little bit more watery than then they were a few seconds ago even thinking about it yes it terrifies it's litter it's terrifying I can't I can't even explain it it's the worst thing I and I have to do it often as an adult and that sucks you know but when I go to an event or something with an extroverted friend and they're like oh my gosh this my friend Sarah have you met her you know like it's just that that initial interaction is kind of glossed over like there's it breaks down that barrier a little bit and then I am free to talk all night every night it doesn't matter but so I don't know I think we complement each other and I do incredibly well in small situations in one-on-ones or maybe just like a few people so I don't know I just think introverts and extroverts complement each other and we need to stop viewing it as a bad thing I agree I think that the thing that you just said about how like it's not about extroverts being bad no not at all I think the it kind of reminded me of the climate that were in right now and I am NOT saying that in the fight between introvert and extrovert are anywhere near the level of the gender gap of women and men above just taking that as kind of example of what is kind of going on right now and just like women are not saying that men need to be brought down a notch they're just saying that we need to be on the same knotch right it's not about bringing men down it's about bringing women up right same with extraversion and introversion yeah it's not about one it's a mindset well for everybody that equality guy everyone is a human being and deserves equal amounts of respect okay well except for unless like in the documentary of human flow last night yeah um at the very end a guy they were interviewing he said unfortunately there are bad people in this world and we just need to send them to space yeah it was an astronaut that said that so we made it um a Syrian astronaut yeah which was very interesting I was like I didn't would never have guesses for Syria to have a space program they do though I guess and they've been to space attack that guy was on and he had a good idea I like it just in all the evil people to space yeah it's fine well I hope you enjoyed this inaugural episode of deeply curious I hope we didn't ruin the conversation of extraversion and introversion so we talked about things we loved and mine was the movie human flow which you can watch on amazon prime you can get a 14-day free trial of Amazon Prime by going to prime dot Cody Jensen comm and Sarah talked about a book that she's reading you are a badass you can check that out on Amazon as well or Barnes Noble or any bookseller near you but we will put a link in the show notes to Amazon and

are listening on your way to work or wherever you're going and stay introverted or extroverted just be you and that that's actually a good segue into one of my favorite things that I say or kind of the reason that I have the fake clothing brand is just be unapologetically yourself yes all right well I guess see you next week bye see ya
