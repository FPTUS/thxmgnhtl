    BRIAN FERRISO This is Art Unbound, the official podcast for the Portland Art Museum and Northwest Film Center. I’m Brian Ferriso, the Director and Chief Curator of the Portland Art Museum, and I’m thrilled to be joined by Sylvain Amic, my counterpart at Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen, in Normandy, France. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Sylvain through FRAME, the French American Museum Exchange, which Portland and Rouen are both members. FRAME has a rich history of connecting museums in its network through exhibitions and education programs for over 20 years, and we’re all so appreciative of their support for this podcast. Relevant links can be found in this episode’s description, and at portlandartmuseum.org/podcast, where you will also be able to find full episode transcripts, both in English and French. Sylvain, thank you so much for joining me on this podcast. How are you?
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC Fine, thank you, Brian for inviting me. I’m thrilled also to join.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO Well, it’s been a few years since you and I spoke and I have such a fond memory. I think we had a coffee outdoors, outside your wonderful Museum, one of my favorite cities, Rouen. And I have to ask, you know, for me getting through the pandemic, part of it was watching Six Nations rugby. And I think you and I talked about it. And I believe France was sort of a favored team this year. And I was disappointed they didn’t make it. But I really want to get your take on the other side of the Atlantic on what happened.
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC Yes, of course, the competition was very hard this year, but we are recovering for very bad years. And France is now back in the Six Nation play. So we were very happy to see all of those match. But it was so tough during the pandemic and we have to postpone some of them. And yes, at the end, of course, English won. But we were close to one the tour of Six Nation, but I’m sure we’ll do a very nice workup in Tour 53 in France.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO Well, you know, one of my favorite things is visiting France, and not only to see world class rugby, but also to see the great museums of France, including yours. Tell me a little bit about your Museum right now. Where are you in the pandemic? Are you open? And how are things operating at your Museum.
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC We are now closed since October. And we have been also closed from March to May 2020. And we have been able to reopen during the summer of 2020. And it was very, very interesting to see how people express to us, they wanted to go back to museum and not only people who are usual in museum but, it was really a need. And it was of course a question because we were very, we didn’t know what we could expect. But yes, now we are closed, and we hope to reopen soon again, maybe in May, of course it’s very, very long for everybody. Of course, also people are staying home, working from distance. And it’s so long that it’s really hard to manage. But of course, we have completely changed the way we are operating the Museums. And we managed to organize new ways for museum, new trend. And we will see what will happen when we reopen. We will see if it has changed really deeply the Museum or not. But the first year was very, very surprising. It was like you know this, this movie, The Day the Earth Stood Still. Everybody was astonished. Now it’s something else. We have to face, to the life with a virus. And everybody knows how to deal with that. So it’s much more question of a global mood. And I think people have- they want to be free now. They want to be free to go to restaurant, to cafe, to go anytime outside and it’s not that. They have to be home at 7pm. They cannot go to restaurants, shops are closed. Only we call essential shops are open. So it’s really not the life we know before. So we will see.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO Yes, it sounds very similar to what we’re experiencing over here as well. We’ve had and, you know, again, I think you and I as leaders of our organizations have had to pivot, which we say, you know, change course every other month on what we’re going to do - open, close, and sort of be responsive. And it sounds very similar. It’s a global pandemic. And I think it’s a global response for museums. For us, we are open, but we’re facing more pressure actually today about perhaps having to close again. There’s a spike right now and these variants and so we’re cautiously optimistic, but again, preparing for potential, an adjustment here soon. But Sylvain, let me ask you, when you’re welcoming people back, your Museum has some of the great pictures of France as well as the Impressionist paintings. Are you finding, and I’m assuming that a lot of your audiences are coming to your Museum when they’re able to, for healing? For a respite? For an escape from what we’re looking at? Can you describe a little bit what you’re seeing with your audiences?
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC Yes, I’m sure people wanted to come back to Museum for an experience. To be in a place where they can think about life and think about the future. And also to reconnect with the basics. And I’m sure that collection as a perfect topic for that because we are, of course, in a museum looking to the past. But this past is building the future. I think that people can have a rest in a museum. They are free to discover things, to think about themselves. They can be alone, can discuss. There is no pressure in a museum. So it’s like looking to a landscape of other people to go to the church and something like that, it’s a moment for your own, like the room for your own that we heard about. So people were coming also to, to see what has changed in the Museum. Because during the closing time we were able to do some hard work. And also we were able to save our Impressionist season, we had nine Impressionists show together, that had to open in this time, because there is fine art, but also 10 other museums that are united together. And in summer 2020, we had an Impressionist season with several topics like fashion and Impressionism or photographic Impressionism or ceramic Impressionism, contemporary art and Impressionism and even botany Impressionism, so we were able to set up all these exhibitions and people were really, they like, people were very, very interested to see all those different topics, and to go from one to the other museum to rediscover the things that they couldn’t afford during closing time. And it’s like that, like people rediscover completely their own heritage, because it was very, very impressive. And the feeling that was sent to us was was a thank you, etc, etc. So it was very, very encouraging for us.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO Well, that sounds like I want to get on a plane and go see those because you know, Sylvain, what I remember about your leadership, as well is you’re very skilled at sort of pulling together these exhibitions that really capture, I think, the moment and what you’re talking about here, sounds really exciting. And then pulling together all those resources, there’s such a great story to be told. So on the exhibition side, you know, we in the United States have different responses. Some museums are more open than others. It’s sort of uneven how my colleagues are able to respond. Our governors for each state have different sort of protocols and orders in place. And so some museums have been open, some are closed. My colleague in Oakland, California, I just spoke to her yesterday, she remains closed, maybe opening in May. the National Gallery in Washington, I think, is opening in May. So we’ve got a lot of different unevenness here in the United States on our museums’ response to the pandemic and ability to open. What about in France? Is it pretty consistent about with the museum’s or is it depending on the region?
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC It’s a state decision, because we’re waiting for signal from the government to reopen, but it may be reopened with a very strict level of admission, maybe 30% only. And then if the situation got better, from one place to the other, we can maybe move to another level, maybe 50-60% of the usual admission. So we will maybe have different situation in the reopening and to admit more or less people in some places, but the moment where we were closed, was, it was in the same time for everybody here in France, and even your small or big museum, even your attendance is very big or not even you have tourism or not. And that’s quite unfair, because there are many, many museum very close to the people, you know, in the territory, not only in the big cities. Now in France, 1,200 museums, and that means you have a museum very close to your door. And sometimes it’s a place where you can be safe, where you can be welcome, when you can, of course, learn. And we would like that museum looks like resources for people. Yes, in some situation, I think it was really unfair to close any museum, as we were all in the same situation. The Louvre, of course, welcomes so many people in the same time, it’s very, very challenging to open the Louvre. But if you’re in a small, very small city, you welcome maybe I don’t know, 200 people a day in a museum. So it’s easy to welcome them. It’s not the same situation. But okay, we have accepted that like a responsibility. We know also that if we are open, we need that the staff come. And so our staff is exposed to the virus. So we accept the situation. And we’re taught to work in other way, and to do more things for the digital. But we hope that for reopening will be more clever, and not one decision for the world country.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO Yes, that makes a lot of sense. And how do we carve out museums as sort of a sector that’s different than restaurants or cafes, or other sectors? And sometimes I think our elected officials put us all in one group, and it makes it more challenging. And especially like you said, I you know, the the Louvre in particular is, is in a remarkable place, but it is very much a lot of tourists as well. So one of the beauties of our FRAME program is celebrating the regionalism of French museums, and the regionalism of the museums in North America. And the treasures are rich and extensive. And that’s ultimately the goal. And I like your point, Sylvain. And it makes so much sense. This idea that our regional museums are for our communities, and that’s what you’re talking about. And whenever I go and visit France and visit your Museum, as well as some of the others throughout the country, you can feel that it’s an intimate relationship with the community, which is sometimes different than the larger city museums. So if you get a chance and those listening to the podcast, there are some remarkable treasures in France and the United States all found on our FRAME website. But let me switch a little bit and move into, you know, the other situation we’ve been facing here in the United States is the social justice movement, which is a continuation of civil rights, which is deeply part of our history here. Some of the oppressions that have taken place in the United States, how is this happening in France? What is happening? What is the conversation there like? I know France, as well, is dealing with some pretty intense issues on this front.
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC Yes, we had this movement called Yellow Vests two years ago, I don’t know if you heard about that. In United States.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO Yes.
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC It was really, really impressive because it was like the beginning of something like a revolution. It was starting from nothing, just taxes on gas, you know, new taxes on gas. And people say we cannot afford it. We need our car to go to work. We don’t need anything else. And so they started to protest. They have been able to gather a lot of protestations and it was really hard to deal with that in the cities because there were riots really close to the museums. It was something difficult to manage. And in this discussion, there were no culture, no museums, just we need attention. We need you. You you respect us. And you can not decide from Paris that new taxes will affect us at the end of the month, we have not enough money. So for us emergency is not culture is not I don’t know. Traveling. It’s not even learning. We just need just more money for the day. And that was really tough for museum to understand. What can we do for people who express that. And last summer, we had some, a global survey of how people act with culture in France. This survey is every 10 years, and we had the results last summer, and it was really bad. We are back to the I don’t know, the 70s - Museums are a thing for educated people and not for workers. Of course, we made a lot of improvements during this decade. But the result is now during this very special times, we went back to the, to the survey from the 70s. So how can we deal with that when we are, we think that we have to involve much more people in our decision, in our choices. People have to express themselves. They can say what they want to see, for example, in our museum, for example, you can vote to put work out of storage, and we have to involve people in the museums because we know that if you are close to the museum, if you go to see exhibition, etc, it’s much more easy for you in your life, in your professional life, for your career, for your, I don’t know, for, for social life. So we have to prove that we are useful to people. It’s not only a storage place, it’s not a place also just for educated people, it’s a place for everybody, for usual people. And they will need the museum during their whole life - after school, after even if the school, the family did not give to them what they need, they can find it in Museums, it’s easy. It’s free - access to the collection is free here in Rouen. And information is verified, if I can say. So we give to the people information they need for their self development, for their education during their whole life. And that’s a new way to consider museum because we have to reorganize display, we have to be much more transdisciplinary. And we have to deal with the topics from today. Diversity, climate change, equity, etc, gender equality, and so on. And this question can be learned, it can be discussed through the collection, through the museum. Museums should be now a place for meeting, for learning, for discussing, and for deciding together what we will do, how we will organize for the future. And that’s the reason we would like to promote but of course, it’s not organized like that right now. But so we have to do a lot of work to be more responsive to the desires of the population, I think.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO So this survey is fascinating. And this is a survey, Sylvain, that is run by the state or the
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC By the state
    
    BRIAN FERRISO By the state. And they they do have sort of an analysis of visitors response or community’s response to museums and you as a leader get that sort of report every 10 years?
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC Yes.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO So I think that translates very much in similar way to what’s happening in the States. We have an incredible economic divide between people, which is creating a wealth gap that is influencing our museums, or impacting, I should say, our museums in a very profound way. And it sounds similar to what I hear is happening, what you described. And for us, it’s about how do we make all people feel like they’re being seen within organization or within museums, or how can they see themselves within museums? And I think that’s a concept that is so important for all of our museums. It’s not just for a certain segment of our society. We need to be open to all in the community, accessible for all rather than a few. And I think that’s so important. We also are addressing these issues in many meaningful ways. And I’ve always found that, you know, these are incremental changes we as museums need to make with our staffs, and our staffs are doing, at least in here in Portland, a remarkable job of inviting the community and for these conversations of how can we make you feel included? And how can we be inclusive institutions, rather than exclusive? And I think that’s really important to this moment. I also find, and Sylvain, it’s interesting to hear you speak, I find it challenging, but at the same time, exciting to think about, because I believe, we’ve gotten into this profession as lifelong learners, people who want to continue to learn and to be challenged to keep ourselves moving forward. And I’m excited by the opportunity, although it is daunting at times. How do you feel about these changes that are upon us, and how you think about it as a leader in your Museum?
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC Of course, we see opportunities even through the pandemic. For example, the way we went to the digital media during the pandemic, now we are much more able to give to the people online, many things that they can see home, and it’s part of inclusivity, because they can- going to the museum is just one way to discover the collection and the knowledge they can can prepare, they can also remember what the visit before after the visit. So that was an opportunity. And we were obliged to go to the digital during the pandemic. And now, I think that also opportunity with a new young generations, because they want really to change standards. And, for example, gender equity, it’s so, so huge today. It has changed completely the way we are managing the museums. This topic is in the mind of everybody in the museum, from curator to education, but also people who welcome and so on. So the way we are displaying the collections, where we are organizing exhibitions, we have gender equity inside from the beginning. So that has changed a lot. So we can just do that for all the topics, we need to be responsive, like social justice, and diversity. And you’re very, you’re right, when you say people have to see themselves in the museum. And today, our community are very diverse, much more diverse than in the past. And of course, the work of art, we conserve we display. They do not reflect the diversity of today. So that’s- so and even for the gender equity, for example, we know that for the work of art we have, I don’t know, only, I don’t know, 10% of work woman artists in the collection. That’s history. But you don’t have enough female artists in your collection. But you have to have a position about that. You have to say it to the public, you have to explain it to the public. And you have to show it in your museum, even if you have nothing to show- things have to be explained to the public. And so the context is really important. But this discussion is not from high to bottom from- it’s on the same basis, same level. As curators, we can have a position like an expert, but as citizen, we are on the same level. So it’s really interesting to see how people can question you and question the museum about this issue of today. And I think this is our opportunity to change quicker than we are usually.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO Yes, so true. And it is forcing us to change in ways very quickly. You’re absolutely right. Sylvain, let me ask you, does that also get reflected in the objects you collect? Are you active collecting, acquiring objects? Here we are, you know, we continue to collect but we’re also trying to represent a much broader what we call canon in art history or of the moment you know more diversity, more women artists, more BIPOC artists, Black, Indigenous, People of Color artists, among others. So, you know, this is an initiative. So is that happening in France as well?
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC It’s coming, yes. Here in Rouen, for example, about gender equity, we did a survey about women artists in our collection. So now we know precisely what we have, what we don’t have. And so we know what we have to acquire. And if you don’t do that before, you cannot have a strategy. But now we can see on the market woman artists are trying to be very high. It’s but so we have to go fast to be the first but there are many, many opportunity to balance our collections. But it’s not only about only art collection, we have also antiquities, and we have also natural science history, textile, and so on. So it’s a global desire to be much more diverse, and to find opportunities that can explain the context where the collection have been collected. So if you for I don’t know if, for example, we about archaeology, you have some women who are archaeologists, and in your collection, you have to find- to go to this scientist, woman scientist and to, to have archives to items that they have studied and to produce on your, on your territory in your community. And it’s not only a question of art. Diversity in all fields, and even when you are like Rouen, an harbor from a place where people came and went to discover the world. And there is a responsibility, an historic responsibility, facing this history, because in the 17th century, Rouen was one of the place where ships were going in Africa, to trade slave to America and come back with sugar and cotton and so on. Of course, we have very few things in our collection about that. So we have to increase our collection in this field, and to be ready to explain that to the public. So we have to also to learn more about this history, which is little to none here in Normandy, and same thing for every topic in our collection, to see the context where they were collected. And when you know, in France, we are the colonial empire. So many things were collected during these centuries and 19th century through the colonial expansion. So all those objects are interesting for themselves, but we have to explain how they came here in the museum. And you cannot just exhibit them for themselves, you have to explain the whole context.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO Yes, the history of the provenance is, is part of the storytelling. And I think, for us, our curators are actually energized by this conversation, because many of them are trained to ask the questions, to be critical thinkers, to think anew about how we approach our objects. And I find it exciting. It’s stretching all of us, I think, intellectually, on how we approach our field. Are you finding in France, the Academy is preparing the next generation of curators, and leaders in this thought? I’m assuming yes, but but but curious how you see it.
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC Yes, I think the new young curator are much more aware about these questions. And they deal with these questions from the beginning. So I think it will be much more easier to walk in this direction with them. But sometimes I find some academic people, students, they have a very radical position, much more radical than the older people. And in a way you need that because it’s part of strategy to put the subject in on the light- in the light. But in another way, we have to find a way to discuss and to be united together. And you know, in France like in the United States, we have deep shifts between some people in in the population. For example, people coming from the old colonial territories, and people are coming from France. And people who were French people who settled in Algeria, for example, they went back to France after independence. And those people now they are old, but the sons or the grandson, they are leading the same mood, and they have to, to everybody has to reconsider the past. And to consider the situation of today and what we know that we have to discuss together. We have to confront, we have to confront the memories, and to hear the other part. And it’s not a question not to be much more radical than the other one, we have to find a way to be together.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO And I think that’s probably the ultimate challenge for us as museum directors right now, how do we build those bridges? What’s the scaffolding look like? Between the energy and the enthusiasm for change and the desire for some to look to the past and stay the same? And the answer is somewhere in between is how do we build those bridges? And I think that’s really comes through our offices often and in the conversations and in our day to day. Shifting topics, I think another thing or another crisis that is hitting us and, you know, I think it’s relevant to France in particular as well with the Paris Accord is climate change. And I’ve been talking to my colleagues about this, I think the pandemic, the social justice movement, climate change, are all coming together to create one moment in time for all of us as leaders and museums, because these issues are intersecting and impacting our museums in profound ways. So for example, last year, I don’t know if you saw Sylvain, in Oregon, we had wildfires beyond anything we could ever imagine. And people ask, Well, how did that affect the Museum? I had many staff who actually were in harm’s way from the fires. So we had to close the Museum because the air quality was so bad in our state. I know we offered refuge for not only our staff, but also community members in the Museum because it is sometimes a safer space than some of the homes out in the countryside. And I think that is just one part of something that we’re going to be dealing with. We all face energy costs, antiquated buildings. You and I have worked in a system where travel is extensive, loan exhibitions, all of these things are part of I think the issues around climate change. What are you seeing from your perspective on these topics? And what’s the conversation like in France?
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC These subjects are now very, very high in the conversations, but how we did with that in Museum, it’s quite a new subject. I think that the biggest Museum in France, like the Louvre, and d’Orsay, Centre Pompidou, they face that different, because everything is bigger, everything is bigger, you know, in those museums, so it’s become very, very urgent for them to have a strategy for climate. I think in the museum world, it is changing relatively quick now. And during the pandemic, as you say, it’s at an intersection because of the pandemic, we were not able to have loans from abroad, and all the museum in the world, they are focusing on their collection. And, in fact, we started to change our policies about borrowing works from abroad, some years ago, because we just see, so that it became so complicated and so expensive to have loans coming from from very foreign countries, that it became like, in a way like for a movie like a blockbuster movie, you can afford it, of course, but the risk is very high. And so if you- if it’s a failure, everything is going bad for you, for your museum and for us, for our cities. So we can just- we cannot afford to be exposed in such risk. So, you know, for example, we have an Impressionist Festival every four years, and I’ve did three Impressions Festivals, so I’ve seen that changing. The first one I had 14 Monet paintings. I was very proud of that. And the second one we have, we had also I don’t know, half of the painting were coming from foreign countries. But last year, during the pandemic, if we had the same situation, we couldn’t just open the show, because with a pandemic, it was impossible to gather works from abroad. So we change it four years ago. And last year, we had 350 items in our in ninth exhibition, and only 3% were coming from foreign countries. So even with a pandemic, we were able to open the show. And that was a good lesson for us. Because we divide the risk in several exhibitions, several topics, I told you botany and ceramic and, and work of art and so on, and painting. And so not the same lenders, not the same kind of works, not the same provenance. And at the end, we were able to open the ninth show, and people are very happy to see them. So that was a good lesson. So I think that things are changing. Now we are much more able to, for example, to manage loans, without a courier. And that’s a new way for lending works abroad, you know, for I don’t know if people are aware about that. But when when you send a painting or a work of art in another country, usually a courier is containing the work and it’s very complicated, expensive, of course. And now we find solution, for example, to avoid that, so it’s less carbon, it’s less expensive. And I think we have created a new way for lending works abroad during the pandemic. Of course, we reduce our exposure to risk, so reduce how many works are coming from far away. But it’s also a very creative moment, because in a way, it’s easy to ask for a masterpiece that everybody knows. And we know very well where they are. It’s much harder to create a show without a famous masterpiece, with things you have to rediscover in your collection or in private collection, or in a museum very close to you. And we stay on that with our last shows. And so we know that now, our carbon balance is much better in a in a show than for an exhibition that before. But it’s not the only way to be active for climate change. Of course, the buildings, when you see the all the museums that have been built since 20-30 years, they’re not designed for climate change, a lot of glass, large windows, glasses, and so on. So when you look back to museum buildings, in the 19th century, it’s much better. There have strong walls and so on. So we have to be aware about that. And when you create a new wing, a new storage area, or new, etc, you have to have this in mind. But it’s not only museum, that’s a general situation for all people leading organization. I think Museum of Art, they can be partner for educate about climate changing, because when you look back to our collection, landscapes, I don’t know ..... Everything is talking about ecology from before, from the past. And so you can learn a lot. It’s like an archive, a climate archive, or collection of like climate archives. So I think to educate people, to warn people about climate changing museums are good places.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO Yes, you know, the both landscape movements in France and the United States celebrated the beauty of the natural world. And I think you’re right, and how can we continue to bring attention to this issue, not only visually, but also, I believe, what you talked about is how do we do it economically and be more better
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC Smarter
    
    BRIAN FERRISO better stewards of our smarter and be smarter in our exhibition planning? You know, I think it’s also a part, role that FRAME can continue to play. I know many of us have sort of collections and whole collections of stories within our institutions. And so partnering one on one rather than with 70 organizations...
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC Exactly
    
    BRIAN FERRISO ...can really create some wonderful efficiencies and opportunities for our audiences. And it’s exciting, and I appreciate you talking about that, because I think it’s very similar here in the States. And Sylvain, you’re right. I mean, I think the way we work is changing and it’s interesting to reflect on the first podcast we did with with FRAME and our partnership with Petit Palais, there was a conversation between our two institutions, the Petit Palais and the Portland Art Museum and how the exhibition future will probably change because of the pandemic. And also you and I are reflecting on climate change. So it’s all coming full circle, I think in this conversation. So other topics, anything else before we sort of wind down here Sylvain that you’re thinking about, or you want to talk about your museum before we close?
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC Yes, I want to just to invite people to come to France and to visit us, of course. And just to tell also to the people that we are not focused on one century or one topic, we are now experiencing much more diversity in our collection, and how you know, thing from the past, thing from the Medieval Ages and thing from modernity. All that is a new story of our knowledge of our culture. And we are now, for example, experiencing to take a book and to adapt it as an exhibition. And we’re just installing an exhibition called Salammbô and Salammbô is originally a novel by Gustave Flaubert, who has reinvented the past during the Punic War in Cartagena. And, of course, the story is much It’s very, it’s very funny story. Not funny, very fancy story with desire, passion, war, elephants, snakes, and so on. It’s very, very nice. And you can see that artists have taken this novel and invented many work of art, music, I don’t know comics, paintings, culture, dresses, and so on. And that also this book, has given the idea doing archaeologist survey of Cartagena, and now we have all that is essential, your archaeology, comic, opera, fine art and so on. And I would like to invite people to go to the museum and do their own melting pot and their own entries in the collection. Because once you can be connected one with the other end the look, we have to the decorations changing, because people can connect much more to their own prospect and their own attempt. So we are experiencing that new way of displaying a collection with new entries, even like following the imagination of the writer through the collection. And I think we don’t need more 40 Monets to have a good show. We need just to have good ideas and good stories to tell.
    
    BRIAN FERRISO Yes, I couldn’t agree more. And what you’re talking about is just more entry points for people to access the great treasures of our museums. And the treasures are hidden as well. As you said that sometimes the big names need to be explored. But also we need to think about the names not known in the history of art and the works that haven’t been shown. In Portland, we have an exhibition that we’re opening up next month on Ansel Adams and Ansel Adams was one of the great photographers of the American West. But what’s interesting about that show is we’re expanding the conversation around his work and thinking about contemporary photographers and how they’ve responded not only to Adams’ display of the American West, but you know, problematizing the issues around the West and the development in America and how we as developed our natural resources and our lands, and different perspectives - how people of different backgrounds, artists of color, or different orientations are presenting the landscape and it’s a it’s a really exciting story. We’re thrilled that it’s gonna be opening up here in Portland here soon and hopefully we can have many people come. Well, Sylvain, thank you so much. And I will say for everyone listening, we both live in incredibly beautiful cities. We live in beautiful communities and it’s well worth your trip when people have time to get to Rouen as well as Portland. I’m going to close with thanking you for listening to Art Unbound. Be sure to subscribe to the podcast so you can be alerted when the next episode is released. I’d like to thank Sylvain Amic for joining me in our conversation and the team at Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen for helping make this happen. I’d also like to thank FRAME, the French American Museum exchange for providing the funds to make this series possible. Thank you also to Mark Orton for providing the music for this episode and Jon Richardson, our producer here at the Portland Art Museum. Be sure to visit portlandartmuseum.org and nwfilm.org to learn about our exhibitions, learning and community partnerships, Film Center opportunities, and ways to support our organizations. Thank you so much. Thank you. Sylvain, great to see you. Stay safe and stay well.
    
    SYLVAIN AMIC Thank you very much, Brian.
