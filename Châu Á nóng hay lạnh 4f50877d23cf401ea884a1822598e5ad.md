    Welcome to the history of Southeast Asia podcast. I am your host, Charles Kimball episode for early Vietnam. Greetings dear listeners. Before we begin, I have a bit of old business regarding a past error. In Episode One, I gave the impression that modern man already knew about the splendid cro-magnon paintings in the caves of France, before the discovery of Java man in 1891. Well, while I was preparing this episode, I found out I was wrong. The Lasco cave, which contains the best examples of caveman art, was only discovered in 1940. And among the other French caves containing art that I looked up, the first to be discovered turned up in 1901 10 years after a Java man was found. Therefore, I have edited the first part of episode one, removing the misleading sentence and uploading an updated mp3 file. Let the record show I won't intentionally post errors on the worldwide web, if I can help it. Now if you downloaded episode one after mid August 2016, or you listen to the episode on the website after that date, kindly disregard everything I just said after Greetings, dear listeners. Now, where where are we? Oh, yeah. If this is the first time you have listened to this podcast, we have been covering the earliest states in Southeast Asia, which started appearing around 2000 years ago. The last episode saw the rise and fall of the loosely organized kingdoms in Cambodia, Thailand, and Northern Malaya before today's Cambodians and Thais arrive to take their place. For this episode, we are going to take a narrower focus than we have used up to this point. Previously, we looked at things happening all over Southeast Asia. But for this episode, we are going to concentrate our attention on one place, the land we call Vietnam. Another change is that we have more written records on early Vietnam than we had on ancient states like Funan. Because the Chinese got involved in Vietnam early on giving us both the Chinese and the Vietnamese sides of the story. Because of the increased supply of sources, you won't hear me say, we can't be sure, or we don't know much about this as often as I did previously. Can we have some applause for that? Thank you. One thing I should point out regarding Vietnamese geography is that for most of history, the land of Vietnam was three countries, not one. Usually, the Vietnamese only ruled the northern third of the land, the area around the Red River Delta. The French called this land Tonkin when it was a colony of France. This is where you'll find Hanoi, the capital, and its seaport Haiphong. The rugged land in the middle of present day Vietnam, became another kingdom we will meet in this episode Ciampa the realm of the charms. Of course Champa isn't around today. And in a future episode of this podcast, you will find out why. Finally, the southern third of the land used to be part of Cambodia until the Vietnamese took it around 1700. This is the area with the Mekong River Delta and Ho Chi Minh City. You can call it Saigon if you are 50 years old or more. And now let's get into the narrative. The origin of the Vietnamese people is uncertain. We mentioned in episode two that the Vietnamese language resembles the Mon Khmer tongues, suggesting they're distant relatives of the moans and Khmers, but there are also a few similarities with the Thai and Malay languages. Furthermore, lengthy contact with the Chinese has caused the introduction of some Chinese grammar into the Vietnamese language, namely, the use of tones to give several meanings to one word, and the restriction of every word to one syllable, or a combination of two or three syllables where one won't do.
    
    The Vietnamese themselves make their first appearance around 1000 BC, when Chinese records reported a tribe that called itself Viet, the Chinese name for it was UAE. The Viets lived at the mouth of the Yangtze River, and most of their land was on that mighty river South Bank, where modern China has the province of Judge Young. Their capital was squeegee. Nowadays it has Shao Xing, a city on Hong Jo Bay. At this time, China was ruled by a feudal monarchy, the Jo dynasty, and the Viet tribe grew into a state, which the Chinese also called UAE. An alternate name is UUA. During the early years of the Jo dynasty, UAE became a vassal of China. See my chin. A Chinese historian who lived in the second century BC, reported that the kings of UAE claimed dissent from you, a legendary king who founded China's first dynasty. In other words, the UAE were saying that they would be Chinese too, if the Chinese hadn't kicked out that early dynasty and replaced it with another one. The claim of Chinese descent may have been invented to justify us relationship with China at this stage. Thus, UAE came to be seen as the southeastern corner of the growing Chinese state. The next time we hear from UE is during the years when China breaks up between 770 and 481 BC. Chinese historians call this time the Spring and Autumn Period, and during this time, there was on and off fighting between the Chinese states. At the end of this period YUI had an exceptionally talented ruler, named Kingo Jin Hee ruled from 496 to 465 BC. Chinese historians like to rank Gougeon with four other excellent leaders during the Spring and Autumn Period. They will call go gn, the last of the five hegemonic. This means he was the best leader in China during his lifetime. As soon as go GN came to power, His kingdom was attacked by Woo, a rival kingdom based on the north bank of the Yangtze. When the two sides met in battle, go gin employed a really bizarre tactic. The UAE army was led by three ranks of Desperados who frightened the enemy by be heading themselves. Though UAE won the battle, this tactic was not often used for obvious reasons. One or two historians that I read have suggested that the Suicide Squad was made up of convicted criminals who had nothing to lose. When YUI and Wu had a rematch in 493 BC. Go Jin was captured and forced to serve the king of Wu. However, go GN was able to recover from this set back, rebuild the state of YUI and weaken whoo by sending bribes to those close to the enemy king. Then in 473 BC, after Wu was weakened by petty wars with other Chinese states, go Jen's struck north and conquered Whoo. By this time, the spring and autumn era was over. And the end of the war between YUI and woo showed how things had changed. Wu was the first major Chinese state to be completely destroyed in this zone of increasing conflict. You he now had both the north and the south banks of the lower Yangtze, including the land or the city of Shanghai would someday be built. The next two and a half centuries in Chinese history is called the age of warring states, because it was an era when the Chinese States fought almost constantly. However, you did not do so well in this civil war. Because the state to the west of it, Chu was a tougher opponent. Chu gained a reputation for ruthlessness when it conquered one state after another, and exterminated the ruling families of Concord states. We have a story about two Lords of a state defeated by Chu, who expected the worst and brought coffins with them when they came to surrender. They were spared, but others were not so lucky. In this way, Chu came to dominate all of South Central China.
    
    In 334 BC, Chu conquered UE and those people of UE who did not want to become slaves of Chu fled southward. Some of them settled in Fujian province, and they founded a kingdom which they called Mon Viet and the Chinese called it min UE. Those of you who listened to episode two will remember this is the area the Malays might have come from before they appeared on Taiwan. Unfortunately, this wasn't far enough away. In 221 BC, China was reunited under the Qin Dynasty, and a Chinese military expedition to the South, conquered the land around present a cantata in Hong Kong. This meant China surrounded the Mon Viet Kingdom on three sides, the North, the West in the South. Instead of stopping in the Mon Viet kingdom, some Viet refugees kept going south. Eventually, they reached the Red River Delta. That is the English name for the river. Today, Vietnam calls it the Hong river while China calls it the UN River. Remember what I said in previous episodes about river deltas being the best place on the Southeast Asian mainland for growing rice. This was one of those places. So the Viet settled down here intermarried with the peoples already living here and became the ethnic Vietnamese we are familiar with. Now that the Vietnamese are in a place that will be part of their country from now on our lengthy introduction to them as done. According to what the Vietnamese tell us, the first state in present day Vietnam was called Vaughn long, the land of the tattooed men. It occupied the Red River Delta, and the land immediately south of it. Supposedly the capital was at Fong Chow, about 50 miles west of Hanoi. The founder was a legendary figure named kinde, Wang Wang. And like the kings of UE, he claimed descent from one of the earliest Chinese kings. In this case, he was supposed to be the great grandson of Shen Nong the second Chinese King and the inventor of agriculture. At eight kings are reported to a followed Qin Dong Wong, but the Vietnamese only remember the names of 18. We also hear that a second state nom Quang existed next door between the Red River and the present day Vietnam China border. All this is probably nothing but a myth. To start with, Vaughn long, has a founding date of 2879 BC, too far back in time to be verified. Secondly, the earliest version of this story that we have was written around 1200 ad, meaning the accounts is closer to our time than it is to the time of the events covered. One of the rules to remember regarding Myths and Legends is that the older the source, the more likely it is that the story is true. Here it is a safe bet that the impossibly old date was put on Vaughn long to make Vietnam look as old as China, and maybe even older. At best. Vaughn long is a vague memory of the Dong song culture. The Bronze Age culture of northern Vietnam that we've mentioned in episodes one and two. The last Vaughn long King was overthrown in 258 BC by an immigrant named Antoine Vong, who renamed the state our lock. My guess is that Antoine Vong was the king of the Viets when they arrived in Vietnam, along that line, Encyclopedia Britannica points to the Hmong, a minority tribe living In the mountains southwest of Hanoi, and suggests that these are the descendants of the people who are living in the Red River Delta before the Viets. Does this mean that the ancestors of the Milan were the citizens of the Vaughan long kingdom, or the Dong sung craftsmen
    
    50 years later, in 208 BC iLok was in turn conquered by a Chinese general named JAL Ttwo. It was a successful campaign, which gave JAL Ttwo control over the northern half of the land of Vietnam, the Chinese province of Guangdong and part of the province of Guanxi. But even while he took over his masters, the previously mentioned Qin dynasty were overthrown, and the Han dynasty took its place. Instead of serving a new emperor, Zhao went native. He took for himself a Viet name, trio da, put on Viet costumes, adopted Viet customs and built himself a capital city on the same spot as modern day Canton. Then he declared the land that he controlled an independent nation called Naam. Viet with himself as its military commander in chief Nam Viet meant the land of the Southern Viets. The Chinese name for it was non YUI. Of course, we get the present name of Vietnam by switching the order of the syllables and non Viet that happened in 1803 ad as a result of correspondence between the Vietnamese and Chinese emperors at that time. The Chinese emperor didn't like the name nom Viet, because it reminded him of times in the past when their country's were enemies. And the Vietnamese Emperor really detested China's favorite name for his country on nom. More about that later. So Vietnam was the compromise name they came up with. Anyway, because we now have Chinese records telling us what was happening at this point. True history will replace the legends. Once this position was secure, true, DOD decided that avoiding a fight with China was the best policy. As a result, when a Chinese Embassy came to naam Viet in 196 BC, he submitted to the authority of the Chinese emperor Gowasu. Chinese officials in return, proclaimed Truda a foreign servant, meaning he was the rightful leader of a vassal state. This work because Gauss Zhu was a laid back fellow, but the Emperor's who came after him weren't as easy to get along with. By 183 BC, relations with China had deteriorated to the point that trio da felt compelled to declare himself an emperor equal to the Chinese emperor. Mon Viet, the other Viet state was impressed enough by this to submit to true docile authority, effectively becoming a vassal of his. After that, he is credited with a rain lasting until 137 BC, meaning he ruled for 70 years and an odd number of days. All this achievement is possible. It is difficult to believe in view of how few monarchs rule that long, even in our time, for example, as I record this, the correct King of Thailand, Rama the ninth has ruled for 70 years, but he did it with the help of modern medicine. And the only living monarch I can think of who comes even close to that is England's Queen Elizabeth the Second. Anyway, whether he ruled for 70 years or not, trio da outlived his son, and he was succeeded by a grandson called trio Mott in Vietnamese, and Zhao, Mo and Chinese. His reign was much shorter from 137 to 122 BC, because trio mot was young and inexperienced that King Amman Viet saw an opportunity renounced this submission and invaded non Viet in 135 BC, forcing trio mot into the embarrassing situation of calling on the Chinese for help. The Chinese responded with an invasion that split mon Viet into two smaller states. What makes trio Mott interesting to us is his tomb, which was discovered intact under the City of Canton in 1983. The inside of the tomb was made to look like a palace. Today there is a museum built over it called the Museum of the Western Han dynasty mausoleum of the non UE King the most impressive artifact is a suit made of jade pieces tied together with silk thread. The Emperor's body was sealed up in this and from a distance, the suit looks like a green and red robot.
    
    Also in the tomb, or 10 swords, bronze containers made in the Dong Sun style, a silver box from Persia, and a bronze Tiger inlaid wood gold. In addition, 15 members of the Emperor's court had been buried alive, so they could serve Him in the next life. Finally, the emperor had a supply of pills made of sulfur, Crystal, arsenic, calcite and alunite. TRiO mob believe this drug would keep him from growing old, but we now think he poisoned himself with his own five colored pills of immortality oops. Non Viet had five emperors at all. You don't have to remember the names of the last three, because none of them are any good. Also, their combined reigns lasted a total of 11 years. Put together, these three cannot even rule for as long as the not very competent trio Mott. Meanwhile, China was under one of its greatest Emperor's Wudi the martial Emperor now in Viet US diplomatic and military duels to keep the Chinese away. But then in 111 BC, a Chinese army came saw and conquer nom Viet completely on the way home from the campaign. The same army conquered mon Viet to the land of mon Viet has been Chinese territory ever since. And China's succeeded in assimilating its population. Today there is an ethnic minority in Fujian province called the min they speak their own dialect of Chinese and wear traditional fashions resembling the traditional fashions of the Vietnamese but otherwise they are considered Chinese. So we are done with them for this narrative. As Fernand Viet, it became a Chinese province named Xiao Qi. At first, the Chinese ruled leniently introducing many things the Vietnamese welcomed, like writing, roads, canals, the plough, draught animals and iron weapons, but the people of non Viet refused to become Chinese. They also resented high taxes, and the drafting of their men for the army or Labor projects. As a result, from the first century AD onwards, the Chinese did everything they could to convert the Vietnamese in the Chinese 1000s of Chinese administrators, soldiers and scholars came in, filling the government jobs previously held by Vietnamese, Confucianism, Taoism and the Chinese language were taught, Chinese customs and fashions became mandatory. Despite all this, only the educated elite were affected much, and even they prefer to speak only Vietnamese at home. The first major rebellion against Chinese rule happened in 39 ad. It was led by Trung truck, the wife of a noble executed by a Chinese commander and her sister Trung knee. They gathered the tribal chiefs with their arm followers attacked and destroyed the Chinese strongholds and proclaim themselves the two queens of an independent Vietnam. However, the Chinese returned with a new army in the year 42 and defeated the rebels. The Trung sisters jumped into a river and drowned to avoid capture by the Chinese. Today in Hanoi, there is a temple dedicated to the Trung sisters, who are honored as the first Vietnamese nationalists. And if you were in a Vietnamese owned business and see a picture of two women riding an elephant, chances are it's them. After that, China tried harder than ever to assimilate the Vietnamese. This time, their grip was strong enough that anyone planning a revolt had to wait until China began to break up in the last year as of the Han Dynasty. In 192, a local official declared an independent mini state in the area He was in charge of this was the southern most part of the province, the land around the modern day cities of way. And Da Nang. By now China was going through the Three Kingdoms era,
    
    a time of civil war described in the famous Chinese novel, The Romance of the Three Kingdoms. I can't talk about the Three Kingdoms story here, because that belongs to Chinese history, not Southeast Asian history. So I will just say that if you haven't read or heard the story, check it out. There is even a Three Kingdoms podcast now. Anyway, because of all the chaos in China, and because the breakaway district was so small and so far away, senior authorities had to let it go while they dealt with more important matters. Remember that district though? This will become Lin Yi, the first chomp state the second Vietnamese uprising came into 48 Another woman, true owl, was in charge, and she is remembered as an Asian Joan of Arc for wearing golden armor and riding into battle on an elephant, leading 1000 soldiers. Unfortunately, she was less successful than the French heroine. China crushed the revolt in six months. And like the Trung sisters tree, you owl escaped the Chinese by drowning herself. There were three more revolts in the sixth century, and the Chinese one every time after the first uprising, the Chinese general ma un erected to bronze pillars on the southern border of the province, because from the Chinese point of view, this was also the southern edge of the civilized world. Beyond those pillars, you could only find demons, ghosts, subhuman savages, and the charms.
    
    Ciampa south of the border declared by the Chinese, a different kingdom was getting started. This was Champa a civilization I have hinted at until now, you probably remember me mentioning that around 1000 BC, some Malays landed on the central Vietnam coast and settled there from 1000 BC to 200 AD. The people living in this area left pottery, bronze and iron objects, which we call the south wing culture. It's a safe bet these are the descendants of the Malays. Then, according to Chinese records, a state named Lin Yi was founded here in 192. We talked about how that happened a couple minutes ago, ruled by a king clad in cotton with gold necklaces and flowers in his hair. The charms brought up pearls from the South China Sea and introduced amazingly strong drugs and incenses warriors wore retain armor and rode elephants into battle. At first, most of the charms were wild tribesmen But like other Malays they were great sailors. So from the start, they experienced the strong influence of Chinese culture, and the even stronger influence of Indian culture. Indian culture one out because of the nearby kingdom of Funan in Cambodia, and because in the three hundreds and 400 ad, Northern India was ruled by the Gupta Empire, which saw boomin trade and brilliant achievements and art and literature. In the last episode, I called foo non superficially Indianized because the upper class of Funan accepted Indian culture. While the lifestyle of the common people didn't change much. Ciampa, by contrast, was totally Indianized. Sanskrit was widely used as a sacred language, and the kings gave themselves Sanskrit names. Yes, that means you're going to meet a bunch of kings with names ending and varman. Just like we saw with the kings of Funan and the names of Ciampa cities were Sanskrit ones as well. And 336 a king the Chinese called fond when sent tribute to the Chinese emperor With a message that they described as being written in barbarian characters, this suggests that the charms were already writing in the Sanskrit alphabet. At the same time, Indian and chomh art styles were identical. So you could say that the charms became more Indian than the Indians themselves. By the late fourth century, there were four Charm City states. I will give you the Sanskrit name of each city first, and then give the modern Vietnamese names Amaravati is modern Quang Nam. The Jaya is modern been din Kaltura is modern not Trung and pond Uranga is modern, fond wrong. A king named Bhadra varman, who ruled from 380 to 413 pulled the four charm states together, making Chapa a unified kingdom. He established the kingdom's first capital at Simha Pora. This name meant Lion City, and it stood in modern Quang Nam Province. Unlike the other cities mentioned a minute ago, no modern city exists on this site. Because the mountain its coast of central Vietnam, could not provide enough farmland to keep the charms fed, their economy was ship oriented. From the start, the charms depended on both trade and piracy, with no particular preference to make a living. Most of the raids were directed North against the Chinese until the Chinese retaliated by destroying the Jaya in 446. Chapa fell under Chinese rule after that, until it regained its independence in 510. Then in the 540s, the decline of Funan gave the jobs and opportunity to expand south and they advanced all the way to the edge of the Mekong Delta. The result of this expansion was that the southern part of the nation became more important.
    
    Around 750 Chinese record stop calling it Lin Yi and started calling it Juan Wang. This name comes from Chinese attempts to translate the name of the southern most city Panduranga. In 774, and 780 to another naval power, Java sent raiding parties against Ciampa. Of course, the chomps retaliated. By now the chomps had the most powerful fleet in the South China Sea, giving them control over the India China trade. Champa even settled some of the tiny islands in the South China Sea. These islands had been making news in recent years, because China claimed all of them for itself. While the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have also claimed parts of the South China Sea. As far as I know, only the charms ever tried to live on those islands, before China dredged up enough sand to make one of the islands big enough for a modern military base. After the year 800 the threat from Java faded, and the charms renewed their attacks on other fronts against the Chinese provinces to the north, and the new Khmer empire to the west. In 854, Indra Varma in the second founded a new dynasty, the six in Chiapas history, and an 875 He showed he was more interested in the north by moving the capital northward again, this time to Indra paura. Modern Da Nang. This marked the beginning of the period when the chomps would build elaborate palaces and temples here, especially at a site called me sown. Eventually me sown would have 70 temples, of which 10 are still standing. However, Indra Varma in the second unlike the Kings before him, was not a Hindu, but a Mahayana Buddhist. So he built a grand Buddhist temple, complete with a monastery. Unfortunately, there isn't much left of this temple. The Americans bombed during the Vietnam War. And since the war ended, looters have been taking away the bricks. Anyway, the skill of the charm soldiers They're strong see power, and they're virtually unassailable land position had all contributed to Ciampa success. But Chapa had also made enemies of all its neighbors, and the charms got more than they bargained for when the Vietnamese regained their independence, and prove themselves to be as aggressive as the charms were.
    
    Speaking of the Vietnamese, it is time to get back to them. I will finish this episode by telling how they threw off the Chinese yoke after wearing it for more than 1000 years, and 541 Chinese magistrate li nom de became so disgusted by the corruption and cruel behavior of his government that he resigned, organized the local nobility and tribesmen and launched a rebellion that expelled the rest of the Chinese administration. Li nom de established a capital for the new state at Hanoi and crowned himself king and 544 but then the Chinese returned and drove him into the wilderness. There he was assassinated by a tribesmen from Laos in 548. The Crown passed to his brother, Li Tian Bao, and he shared power with his best general trio Quang fuq until they threw the Chinese out again in 550. Incidentally, this is the first time we hear of the Vietnamese fighting with guerrilla tactics, something they will become famous for in the 20th century. Two more Vietnamese kings followed ruling from 555 to 602. Before the Chinese showed up yet another time and regain control. The last king abdicated when he saw the Chinese forces were more than he could handle. In the seventh century, a new dynasty of Chinese emperors. The Tang dynasty took over, and they were the strongest rulers China had seen since the Han Dynasty. wherever their armies went, they were successful. After their campaigning was finished, fourth, special military districts were set up to administer the conquered areas with non Chinese populations. Accordingly, they called Central Asia on she, the pacified West, Mongolia became on Bay, the pacified north, and Manchuria was named on Dong, the pacified east. In the case of Vietnam, the Tang Dynasty put down some minor revolts at first, and then in 679, they gave this territory a new name on nom, the pacify itself. This name stuck, though, as we noted before, the Vietnamese hated the name, foreigners would call them armies or honor mites, all the way until the 1950s. Like other dynasties, the tongue rose and fell, and their control over Vietnam began to weaken after 750. This encouraged Java, the stage arrayed on Vietnam and 767 and in 780, Chapa bid off the provinces of Wei Quang tree and Quang Binh. At this point, Chopper was at its peak, it was larger now than it would be at any other point in its history. Then an 862 and 863. Non gel, the first Thai Kingdom rated Vietnam to when the Tang Dynasty was replaced by anarchy in the early 10th century, another round of corruption, Palace intrigues, and peasant unrest followed, and then the Vietnamese saw another opportunity to make a bid for independence. After seven years of fighting, the decisive battle took place in 1938. Here a Chinese fleet brought reinforcements and the Vietnamese commander, Ingo Korean, defeated it with a trap. He had his men drive poles, bearing iron spikes into the riverbed at the mouth of the botch dang River, and then at high tide, he had his own ships into the river, giving the impression that they were fleeing the Chinese fleet. pursued sailing over the poles, and a few miles upstream in Goku in order to ships to turn around and attack. In this clash, the Chinese got the worst of it and tried to retreat. But because the tide had gone out by now, their ships were impaled on the spikes. More than half of the Chinese force was killed in the last phase of the battle. Among the dead was the commanding Admiral, who also happened to be a Chinese Prince. This sent a very strong message to the Chinese emperor. He never came back, and the Vietnamese were free at last.
