Tell me about a time when you _________ a challenge at work. So it's not really a question: They're asking you to _________ a story. So tell me about a time when you overcame a challenge at work, so they want to hear an example from your professional _________ about how you solved a problem: what did you do to _________ a problem at work? They want to know what kind of problem it was and how you _________ the problem and the results of that problem. So you could say, for example, our company party was _________ for the day before Christmas, but the restaurant _________ and I had to find a new place to have the party, I don't know. that's, (not) of course, a crazy example, but giving your employer an idea of how you solve problems and maybe the kind of _________ state you have when you solve the problems can be helpful in making a _________ decision. So in an example: "When I was having trouble _________ with a client I reached out to a co-worker for support"

    back to the English pod my name is Marco and I'm Erica and today we're bringing you another great advanced lesson for all those advanced users out there that's right this is a really really useful lesson for all of our advanced users exactly you asked for a lesson about job interviews and well here we are we're bringing you the first of three parts of the job interview series all right so Marco you said it is the first of three parts so tell me what are these three parts okay in this lesson we're gonna be looking at preparing for a job interview okay so everything you got to do before the job interview part two we'll be talking about your education your background your work experience okay and in part three we'll take a look at some of the common questions that are asked at a job interview and so we'll talk about some great ways to answer these questions exactly alright these three lessons will be coming out over the next month or so exactly so we're gonna be looking at part one today so let's take a look at some vocabulary preview vocabulary preview well we have three words here in vocabulary preview that you'll hear in the dialogue in a moment and the first one is actually not really a word but an acronym right CRM CRM CRM so Marco you are our marketing guy tell us what is the CRM well it's really common in marketing it stands for customer relationship management okay or customer relation management but basically it's the relationship that the company has with its customers okay so CRM basically has parts like feedback or customer support problems that they might have and also information about habits and likes and dislikes from their customers or users okay but I commonly hear this word used as a noun so something like can you check in the CRM right there is some software out there that that's called the CRM so Sugar CRM or many different software's which basically manages your database of customers basically software then in globes this whole thing okay all right our next phrase in vocabulary preview custom-designed custom design designed custom designed so when something is custom designed it means it's a special design just for you so it's unique right that's what the word custom means unique like made especially for one person right so you have custom designed or also custom made you see that a lot for example in cars right a custom made car yes or maybe a custom built house a custom build house yep with your specific likes and dislikes yeah your requirements yep okay and our last word core values for values core values core values so the core values of a company what is the core mean actually the center the center right yeah so and here I think it's like the center or the most important the most important things the company believes in right right so maybe respect for the environment okay or developing their employees mm-hmm okay so the core values yeah main things that the company believes in a great phrase for job interviews oh yes very good phrase okay so why don't we listen to a dialogue Erica what exactly is happening all right we're gonna be listening to two friends and this guy is getting ready to go on a job interview so his friend is helping him to prepare okay okay so let's go over everything one more time I really want you to get this job I know it's an amazing growth opportunity they're true industry leaders and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development so let's see you did your research on the company right Wow I visited the website and read up on what they do they're an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations they provide services such as CRM development and they also offer custom design applications so what would be your role in the company well the position is for an Account Manager that basically means that I would be the link between our clients and our development team sounds good and so why do you want to work with well as I said there the industry leaders they have a really great growth strategy amazing development opportunities for employees and it seems like they have a strong corporate governance they're all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me oh and they offer six weeks vacation stock options and bonuses I'm totally gonna cash in on that you heed you don't say that do you want this job or not all right so he was doing great but in the end he said something he shouldn't write yeah I don't think talking about money as your primary motivation for coming on to a new company is really the way to go yeah and we're gonna talk about that a little bit later but let's take a look real quick at some language takeaway language takeaway all right in this lesson we have five key words for you from the dialogue which we hope that you will remember mm-hmm let's take a look at the first one undisputed undisputed undisputed undisputed so this is kind of a strange word let's listen to some examples before we explain it example one it's undisputed that she's the best person for the job example two the undisputed truth is that unemployment is rising no one doubts that example three is the undisputed champion of the world well I can understand from these examples that it means there is no doubt there is no doubt there is no question okay now let's take a look at our second word growth opportunity growth opportunity it's a great growth opportunity mm-hmm so it's an excellent chance to improve write improve professionally and also on a personal side right yeah so talking about growth opportunities we can also use the phrase a development opportunity and it's the same thing yeah to develop to grow to improve yourself okay now let's take a look at a third word read up read up read up read up so when you read up on something well obviously you read it right right but you're reading it specifically for some information so you can know more about the subject so it's kind of similar to study right kind of but really what the idea that you're trying to improve your knowledge about a particular field okay now for our fourth word unleash potential unleash potential unleash potential unleash potential okay so to unleash all right well I'm gonna paint a picture for you all right um so imagine you have your dog right mm-hmm and your dog is walking on a leash like it has a string or a rope attached to it right so then when you undo the leash you unleash the dog and then what happens it goes around and it's running yeah yeah it's going everywhere uh-huh so if you unleash potential you release it and let it go and help it grow and yeah I'm bigger yes you give it freedom uh-huh so potential is the capabilities or abilities that a person has right yeah to do something great mhm okay unleash potential this I think is an excellent word to use in a job interview guys I think it is really descriptive and really powerful yeah it is yeah that's a good word okay so let's take a look at her last one now resonate with resonate with resonate with resonate with so he mentioned this really resonated with me so what does he mean by resonated I guess he means it Connect to him right in touch town so he agrees with this idea or he feels that he can relate to it yeah exactly you know what I think this one needs a few examples to really show its meaning okay let's listen example one the candidates speech really resonated with the voters example two their music doesn't really resonate with me example 3 their commitment to fight global warming resonates with me alright so it's clear now to resonate with right okay so why don't we go and listen to our dialogue for the last time and then we'll come back and give you some great pointers about preparing for a job interview okay so let's go over everything one more time I really want you to get this job I know it's an amazing growth opportunity they're true industry leaders and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development so let's see you did your research on the company right well I visited the website and read up on what they do they're an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations they provide services such as CRM development and they also offer custom designed applications so what would be your role in the company well the position is for an Account Manager that basically means that I would be the link between our clients and our development team sounds good and so why do you want to work with them well as I said they're the industry leaders they have a really great growth strategy amazing development opportunities for employees and it seems like they have a strong corporate governance they're all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me oh and they offer six weeks vacation stock options and bonuses I'm totally gonna cash in on that you idiot you don't say that do you want this job or not [Music] okay so preparing for a job interview is really important right yeah and we're gonna give you some really basic tips about how you can prepare for a job yeah I've got a confess something to you Marco what I love job interviews really yeah I know it's really weird most people hate them but I love them so you love being the interviewer or going to job in your does really yeah I like everything about them so I feel like I have a lot of passion all right so let's take a look at the first point or the first tip that you can help us out with so before you go to a job interview you should do a little bit of research right right and that's our first point um it's really important to know as much as you can about the company their history their product their management style just as much information as you can find out about how they work and what they do uh-huh and why do you think this is important well basically um you'll be asked about it in the interview right and so if you show that you haven't prepared you haven't done any research you show that you don't care one of the best ways that you can impress in a job interview is to show that you know about the company important things like you know what kind of products they offer or what's their largest market yeah and I guess that really impresses the interviewer because it shows that you are interested in this company that you really want the job and that you are willing to do the extra work it takes to prepare yourself because I think that will show the interviewer that later on when you're working for them you'll do that extra work on the job exactly that's a really good point so that's our first point our first tip to do some research yes now you've done your research you know everything about the company what else should you do once you've read up on the company you've got to spend some time thinking about yourself mm-hmm you've got a prepare to sell yourself to the company so to sell yourself to really demonstrate them why you are the perfect person for the job right because a lot of people think about why they want to work for the company right because they feel like they're aligned with the core values or the message of the company resonates with them but what the interviewer really wants to hear is how you the interviewee is going to benefit the company what are you gonna bring to the company right and this is the most important part is to know what are your skills right yes and it's not enough to just say well I am a great leader yeah right so if you are a great leader you should be ready to give an example of how you have demonstrated to be a great leader yes all right so maybe like an example like I'm a really strong leader because in my previous job I had the best JD power ratings for employees satisfaction mm-hmm okay so you're actually showing with numbers or facts that you are a great leader yeah so the key thing here I think is identify what your strengths and skills are think of specific examples if you can give numbers and show how you can bring this skill and your experiences to the new company and now well you're ready to sell yourself you've done your research now you have all of these things in your mind you have to practice yes right I'm a much overlooked stage in the preparation yeah a lot of people think it through they they write things down but don't really practice yeah so I know you have a few tips about how you can practice interviewing effectively mm-hmm okay well the first thing that you should do is use your friends yeah right it gotta be good for something exactly and well probably your friends are also working at a company maybe their managers or maybe they've interviewed someone before already so you can set up a mini interview and have them pretend that they are the interviewers and ask you these questions and you're trying to answer seriously and I'm sure that your friends can give you some great feedback maybe what you did right maybe what you did wrong so that's a really good way and another thing is also you can record yourself yes right yeah if you have a video camera are you gonna web I mean many people have a webcam like right in your laptop um record yourself actually doing the practice interview with your friends and this is really useful because you can later see what you recorded and detect some of the things that maybe aren't really useful or good you know for example posture is a really important aspect so what do you mean posture so the way that you are sitting down in your seat yeah and how you are expressing yourself with your hands yeah some people you know they move a lot during their because of course you're nervous so maybe they're moving from side to side or playing with their feet or playing with something on the table or moving their hands in an awkward way so those are the things that you have to watch out for yes so I guess it's really important to sit up straight and to show that you are powerful and in control and another really great thing is eye contact right yeah yeah we were talking about this earlier and I why is eye contact so important yeah an interviewee maintains eye contact with me for like most of the interview I feel like they have really good people skills in my opinion I would say they have a lot of self-confidence yeah I'd agree right yeah because if a person is looking down or not looking directly at you it's either one of two things in my opinion it's either they are not confident enough with themselves or they are lying to you yes right yeah or also they just they don't have good people skills yeah yeah which is a problem in today's sort of knowledge-based economy exactly so it's really important maintain eye contact and one other really important thing related to eye contact posture yeah is the handshake mm-hmm when you get to the interview it's really really important to give a firm good handshake so what qualifies as a firm good handshake well you don't have to prove that you are ultra strong right so you don't have to squeeze the other person's hand really hard and like break their hands exactly yeah it's not like a strength contest no a good firm handshake is squeezing normally not too tight not too loose yeah but your entire palm your entire hand has to be in contact with the other person's palm or hand yes don't give them the fingers you know like some people give you only four fingers or half their hand yes I hate that I hate it too and this goes for men and for women yes a lot of women do this yep I call this the dead fish handshake it is kind of like a dead fish or the dead hand hand yeah yeah I absolutely agree with you on this one so nice firm handshake yeah firm handshake and well these are our tips for preparing for the interview everything you have to do before it I'm sure there are a lot more things out there so and I'm sure our users have some insight on this as well yeah I'd love to hear it cuz like I told you I love job interviews yeah so come to our website at English pod on leave us your comments maybe you've had a good experience with a job interview or maybe a bad one or maybe even as an interview where you've interviewed some really interesting people and you've got some great tips to share with us exactly so come to our website leave your questions leave your comments share your experiences with our other users and Eric and I will also be there too to participate in the discussion all right guys well thanks for listening and until next time goodbye
